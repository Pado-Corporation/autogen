GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n",

FLAML will dispatch your job to the distributed Spark backend using [`joblib-spark`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib-spark).\n",

      "Please note that you should not set `use_spark` to `true` when applying AutoML and Tuning for Spark Data. This is because only SparkML models will be used for Spark Data in AutoML and Tuning. As SparkML models run in parallel, there is no need to distribute them with `use_spark` again.\n",

This can be used to accelerate training on large models and large datasets, but will incur more overhead in time and thus slow down training in some cases. GPU training is not supported yet when use_spark is True. For Spark clusters, by default, we will launch one trial per executor. However, sometimes we want to launch more trials than the number of executors (e.g., local mode). In this case, we can set the environment variable `FLAML_MAX_CONCURRENT` to override the detected `num_executors`. The final number of concurrent trials will be the minimum of `n_concurrent_trials` and `num_executors`.\n",

      "To use Spark for parallel training in FLAML, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prepare your data in the required format. FLAML only consumes Spark data for Spark estimators. You can use the `to_pandas_on_spark` function from the `flaml.automl.spark.utils` module to convert your data into a pandas-on-spark dataframe. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "from flaml.automl.spark.utils import to_pandas_on_spark\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create a dictionary\n",
      "data = {\n",
      "    \"Square_Feet\": [800, 1200, 1800, 1500, 850],\n",
      "    \"Age_Years\": [20, 15, 10, 7, 25],\n",
      "    \"Price\": [100000, 200000, 300000, 240000, 120000]\n",

      "# Convert to pandas-on-spark dataframe\n",
      "psdf = to_pandas_on_spark(dataframe)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Use the Spark ML estimators in FLAML. FLAML integrates estimators based on Spark ML models. You can include the models you want to try in the `estimator_list` argument when creating an instance of `flaml.AutoML`. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import flaml\n",

      "automl = flaml.AutoML()\n",
      "settings = {\n",
      "    \"time_budget\": 30,\n",
      "    \"metric\": \"r2\",\n",
      "    \"estimator_list\": [\"lgbm_spark\"],  # Optional: specify the Spark ML estimator\n",
