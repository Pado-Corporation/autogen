Orest Wowkodaw: 
Oh, hi, good morning. Grant, I was hoping we could get some colour on what's happening with 
contracting. Obviously, the uranium price has moved up a lot, even in the last three months. I'm 
wondering what kind of behaviour you're seeing from your customers, whether the higher price 
movement is actually engaging them to sign more contracts, or whether you're seeing them 
pulling back? Alternatively, how's Cameco approaching this behaviour? Are you continuing to 
pull back in terms of signing contracts, in hopes of better terms with respect to higher floors and 
ceilings down the road? Just wondering what that engagement looks like right now. 
Grant Isaac: 
Yes, Orest, great questions. Great place to start. There have been a lot of opportunities to be 
with customers in the last couple of months, the WNA Symposium that Tim referred to, as well 
as the recent NEI Conference in Charlotte. 
There still is a very pervasive urgency in the market. That urgency is reflected in improving 
contracting rates. We now are looking at, year-to-date across the industry, about 145 million 
pounds contracted. That is much higher than it had been in each of the last 10 years, starting to 
approach that durable replacement rate contracting. 
I would say, in general, it is a broad-based demand recovery. It reflects demand from those who 
might have thought they had been shutting down a reactor early coming to the market, those 
who are now pursuing life extensions for reactors that might have been retired after their initial 
license extension, and then of course it's demand for those who are building new. It also has a 
very important regional focus, and that is the emergence of Central and Eastern European 
customers into the Western supply piece, which is a demand that is new and is, quite frankly, 
competitive with the demand that we used to see from Western Europe, from North America, 
Canada, the U.S., as well as parts of Asia. So it is broadly based. 
I would say that there are some utilities that have been more aggressive than others in shoring 
up their longer-term supply; probably no surprise, those who are on the frontend of rising 
electricity prices and energy security have moved quicker. I would say that is characteristic of 
Western European utilities, as well as Central and Eastern European utilities. The good news,

The ongoing conflict and economic sanctions may also give rise to additional indirect impacts, including increased fuel
prices, supply chain challenges, logistics and transport disruptions and heightened cybersecurity disruptions and threats.
Increased fuel prices and ongoing volatility of such prices may have adverse impacts on our costs of doing business.
We have not yet been materially affected by the current conflict and economic sanctions, but there remains significant 
uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the ongoing conflict, future economic sanctions, our contractual arrangements 
with Energoatom and shipments of our share of finished JV product. We will continue to monitor the potential impacts on
our business as the situation develops.
Proposed acquisition of Westinghouse risks
Delay or failure to complete the acquisition
The acquisition of Westinghouse may be delayed or may not be completed on the terms contemplated in the acquisition 
agreement or at all. No assurance can be given that the acquisition will be completed when expected, on the terms proposed 
or at all. Closing of the acquisition is subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of various 
closing conditions. There is no certainty, nor can we provide any assurance, that these conditions will be satisfied or, if 
satisfied, when they will be satisfied.
Given a potentially long period prior to closing the acquisition, there can be no assurance that Westinghouse or its operations 
and assets will not be adversely affected by intervening events before the closing of the acquisition. The relevant regulatory 
authorities may decline to give approval or clearance for the acquisition, or may attach terms or conditions to their approval or 
clearance, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of, or 
complete, the acquisition. 
If the acquisition is not completed, we could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and the 
market price of our common shares, including:
• the time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the acquisition could otherwise have been 
devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; 
• the market price of our common shares could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market 
assumption that the acquisition will be completed;
• we would not realize any or all of the benefits we expect to realize from completing the acquisition; and
• we will be required to pay costs relating to the acquisition, such as legal, accounting, and financial advisory fees, whether 
or not the acquisition is completed.
We may also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition. If the acquisition is not completed, these 
risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial results, and financial condition, as well as the price of 
our common shares, which may cause the value of an investment in our common shares to decline.
No financing condition in the acquisition agreement
There exists no closing condition for financing under the acquisition agreement that we can rely on to terminate the acquisition 
agreement. As a result, if our new credit facilities to finance the acquisition were not available, we would remain obligated to 
complete the acquisition and may not have sufficient funds to do so or may have to incur additional costs to do so, which could 
result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions and regulatory approvals
The acquisition closing is subject to certain closing conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all, 
which may prevent or delay the consummation of the acquisition. Any delay in completing the acquisition may reduce or 
eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition. These, include, among other things:
• the receipt of certain approvals under applicable antitrust laws and foreign investment laws;
• the receipt of required national security clearances;
• the conclusion of the applicable notice period under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or receipt of the consent of 
the US Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls; and

Water, power and heat
Groundwater wells provide sufficient water for all planned industrial activities. Potable water for use at the camp and at site 
facilities is supplied from shallow wells on the site. The site is connected to the national power grid. In case of power outages, 
there are standby generators. Operations continue throughout the year despite cold winters (lows of -35°C) and hot summers 
(highs of +40°C). 
Employees
Taikonur has a population of about 680 who are mainly employed in uranium development and exploration. Whenever 
possible, JV Inkai hires personnel from Taikonur and surrounding villages. 
Mining
Mining at Inkai is based upon a conventional and well-established ISR process. ISR mining of uranium is defined by the IAEA
as:
“The extraction of ore from a host sandstone by chemical solutions and the recovery of uranium at the surface. ISR extraction 
is conducted by injecting a suitable leach solution into the ore zone below the water table; oxidizing, complexing and 
mobilizing the uranium; recovering the pregnant solutions through production wells; and finally, pumping the uranium bearing 
solution to the surface for further processing.”
ISR mining at Inkai is comprised of the following components to produce a uranium-bearing lixiviant (an aqueous solution 
which includes sulphuric acid), which goes to settling ponds and then to the processing plants for production as yellowcake: 
• Determination of the GT (grade x thickness) cut-off for the initial design and the operating period. The design sets a 
lower limit to the pounds per pattern required to warrant installation of a pattern before funds are committed, and the 
operating cut-off applies to individual producer wells and dictates the lower limit of operation once a well has entered 
production.
• Preparation of a production sequence, which will deliver the uranium-bearing lixiviant to meet production requirements, 
considering the rate of uranium recovery, lixiviant uranium head grades, and wellfield flow rates.
• Wellfield development practices, using an optimal pattern design, distribute barren lixiviant to the wellfield injectors, and 
then collect lixiviant, which carries the dissolved uranium, back to the MPP, Sat1 or Sat2, as the case may be. 
The above factors are used to estimate the number of operating wellfields, wellfield patterns and wellfield houses over the 
production life. They also determine the unit cost of each of the mining components required to achieve the production 
schedule, including drilling, wellfield installation and wellfield operation.
There is ongoing wellfield development to support the current production plan. The mining project documents are being
updated following the 2021 completion of the resource estimate report as described in Exploration on page 67 below. 
Processing 
As a result of extensive test work and operational experience, a very efficient process of uranium recovery has been 
established. The process consists of the following major steps:
• uranium in-situ leaching with a lixiviant
• uranium adsorption from solution with IX resin
• elution of uranium from resin with ammonium nitrate
• precipitation of uranium as yellowcake with hydrogen peroxide and ammonia
• yellowcake thickening, dewatering, and drying
• packaging of dry yellowcake product in containers 
All plants load and elute uranium from resin while the resulting eluate is converted to yellowcake at the MPP. Inkai is designed 
to produce a dry uranium product that meets the quality specifications of uranium refining and conversion facilities. Overall 
recovery in 2022 slightly exceeded our target of 85%.

by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality and the NRC. Restoration of Smith Ranch-Highland wellfields is 
regulated by the WDEQ. 
See page 97 for the status of wellfield restoration and regulatory approvals.
Kazakhstan
In its resource use contract with the Kazakhstan government, JV Inkai committed to conducting its operations according to 
good international mining practices. It must comply with the environmental requirements of Kazakhstan legislation and 
regulations, and, as an industrial company, it must also reduce, control, or eliminate various kinds of pollution and protect 
natural resources. JV Inkai is required to submit annual reports on pollution levels to the Kazakhstan environmental, tax and 
statistics authorities. The authorities conduct tests to validate JV Inkai’s results.
Environmental protection legislation in Kazakhstan has evolved rapidly, especially in recent years. As the subsoil use sector has 
evolved, there has been a trend towards greater regulation, heightened enforcement, and greater liability for non-compliance. 
The most significant development was the adoption of the Ecological Code in 2007. This code replaced the three main laws 
related to environmental protection. Kazakhstan enacted a new ecological code, which took effect July 1, 2021 (2021 Ecological 
Code).
JV Inkai is required to comply with environmental requirements during all stages of the project and must develop an 
environmental impact assessment for examination by a state environmental expert before making any legal, organizational, or 
economic decisions that could have an effect on the environment and public health. 
Under the 2007 Ecological Code, JV Inkai required an environmental permit to operate. The permit certifies the holder’s right 
to discharge emissions into the environment, provided that it complies with the requirements of the permit and that code. JV 
Inkai obtained a permit for environmental emissions and discharges for the operation under the 2007 Ecological Code. This 
permit is no longer in effect. JV Inkai has obtained a permit under the 2021 Ecological Code.
Facilities, based on their environmental impact, are divided into 4 categories both under the 2007 Ecological Code and the 
2021 Ecological Code. In August 2021, JV Inkai was assigned category 1 and obtained an emissions permit under the 2021
Ecological Code, valid until the end of 2030. Generally, this new permit is similar to an emissions permit issued under the 2007 
Ecological Code. After expiry of this emissions permit at the end of 2030, JV Inkai will be required to have a comprehensive 
environmental permit. 
A comprehensive environmental permit includes standards for emissions, waste accumulation, and water use. An operator of 
a category I facility must introduce and invest in best available techniques. The best available techniques are technologies, 
ways, and methods that are used during an activity and are effective, advanced, and practically applicable. Operators of 
category I facilities who operate under this permit and invest in best available techniques are exempt from payments for 
emissions into the environment.
JV Inkai also holds the required permits under the Water Code.
Government authorities and the courts enforce compliance with these permits, and violations can result in the imposition of 
administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the suspension or stopping of operations, orders to pay compensation, orders to 
remedy the effects of violations and orders to take preventive steps against possible future violations. In certain situations, the 
issuing authority may suspend or revoke the permits. With the adoption of the 2021 Ecological Code, the level of 
administrative penalties has generally been increased. 
The ISR mining method at Inkai uses an acid in the mining solution to extract uranium from underground non potable aquifers. 
The injection and recovery system is engineered to prevent the mining solution from migrating to the aquifer above the 
orebody, which has water with higher purity.
JV Inkai is not required to actively restore groundwater post-mining. After a number of decommissioning steps are taken, 
natural attenuation of the residual acid in the mined-out horizon, as a passive form of groundwater restoration, has been 
accepted. Attenuation is a combination of neutralization of the groundwater residual acid content by interaction with the host 
rock minerals and other chemical reactions which immobilize residual groundwater contaminants in the mined-out subsoil 
horizon. This approach is considered acceptable because it results in water quality similar to the pre-mining baseline status.
=====================================
2022 ANNUAL INFORMATION FORM Page 90
Wyoming
The uranium recovery industry is also regulated by the WDEQ, the Land Quality Division (LQD) according to the Wyoming 
Environmental Quality Act (WEQA) and the Land Quality Division Non Coal Rules and Regulations under the WEQA. 
According to the state act, the WDEQ issues a permit to mine. The LQD administers the permit. As of September 30, 2018, 
the NRC has entered into an agreement with the state of Wyoming, transferring regulatory authority for licensing, rulemaking,
inspection, and enforcement activities necessary to regulate uranium ISR mining. The WDEQ LQD Uranium Recovery 
Program (URP) has assumed this regulatory authority.
The state also administers a number of EPA programs under the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Some of the 
programs, like the Underground Injection Control Regulations, are incorporated in the Land Quality Division Non-Coal Rules 
and Regulations. Wyoming currently requires wellfield decommissioning to the standard of pre-mining use. 
Nebraska
The uranium recovery industry is regulated by the NRC, and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality according to 
the Nebraska Environmental Protection Act. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality issues a permit to mine. The 
state requires wellfield groundwater be restored to the class of use water standard. 
Land tenure
Our uranium resources in the US are held by subsidiaries located in Wyoming and Nebraska. The right to mine or develop 
minerals is acquired either by leases from the owners (private parties or the state) or mining claims located on property owned 
by the US federal government. Our subsidiaries acquire surface leases that allow them to conduct operations.
Kazakhstan
See Kazakhstan government and legislation starting on page 62.
Complying with environmental regulations
Our business is required to comply with laws and regulations that are designed to protect the environment and control the 
management of hazardous wastes and materials. Some laws and regulations focus on environmental issues in general, and 
others are specifically related to mining and the nuclear sector. They change often, with requirements increasing, and existing 
standards being applied more stringently. While this dynamic promotes continuous improvement, it can increase expenses 
and capital expenditures, or limit or delay our activities.
Government legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions establish standards for system performance, standards, 
objectives and guidelines for air and water quality emissions, and other design or operational requirements for the various 
SHEQ components of our operations and the mines that we plan to develop. In addition, we must complete an environmental 
assessment before we begin developing a new mine or make any significant change to our operations. Once we have 
permanently stopped mining and processing activities, we are required to decommission and reclaim the operating site to the 
satisfaction of the regulators, and we may be required to actively manage former mining properties for many years. 
Canada
Not only is there ongoing regulatory oversight by the CNSC, the SMOE, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, and 
Environment and Climate Change Canada, but there is also public scrutiny of the impact our operations have on the 
environment.
The CNSC, an independent regulatory authority established by the federal government under the NSCA, is our main federal 
regulator in Canada. In 2019, the federal government introduced the Impact Assessment Act along with changes to the 
Fisheries Act and introduced the Canadian Navigable Waters Act. The new assessment legislation broadens the scope of a 
federal assessment beyond strictly environment, and the Fisheries Act and the Canadian Navigable Waters Act introduced
changes to the language that will take some time to fully understand as the government is still developing and issuing 
guidance and working out the impact of the revisions.
Plans to build new mines in Saskatchewan are subject to the provincial environmental assessment process. In certain cases, a 
review panel may be appointed, and public hearings held.

Operator: 
Our next question comes from Katie Lachapelle of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. 
Katie Lachapelle: 
Thanks, Operator. Good morning, Tim and Grant. 
Most of my questions have already been addressed, but maybe just one quick one. Your team 
just returned from the NEI Conference, I'm assuming in Charlotte last week, and now we've got 
spot prices sustainably above $70 a pound. What was the chatter among the industry 
participants at the NEI Conference, and how, if at all, have these conversations evolved since 
WNA as in September? 
Tim Gitzel: 
Well, Katie, I wasn't there, so the information I got was from one of the weekly publications that 
comes out. But Grant had a team there, and I know some of his people, and I saw a report go 
through to Grant. Do you want to give an update on what your marketing people saw, Grant? 
Grant Isaac: 
Yes. That particular conference, Katie, really is dominated by U.S. utilities. Unlike, say, the WNA 
Symposium that has a lot more of the global utility base there, that is very much a U.S. utility￾focused conference. 
The U.S. utilities, I think, as a whole, have been slower to respond to the energy security and 
the clean energy and the long-term contracting that you would want to start to put in place. I 
guess no surprise as a consequence, at the NEI conference just recently there was a strong 
sense of urgency, that there are many utilities who may have left it later than they should have. 
There's a high expectation of demand to come to the market; this is a market that is 
experiencing a lot of off-market activity where utilities are trying to quietly find material. They 
don't want to be putting RFPs in the market and having a bunch of them all in at once, sending 
a very strong demand signal.

the nuclear industry, cause public sentiment to shift more in favour of phasing-out nuclear power, and reverse or halt the 
recent positive trend towards nuclear power. The reaction to any such major accident or disaster could be significantly more 
severe, and may result in a rapid global abandonment of nuclear power generation. Any such event may result in, among 
other things, a significant reduction in the demand for uranium and the resulting decline in the price of uranium plus a 
significant reduction in demand for nuclear services or production of new power plants.
A major accident at a nuclear power plant, or a similar disaster related to the nuclear industry, could have a material and 
adverse effect on our and Westinghouse’s earnings, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
We do not currently control Westinghouse and will not control Westinghouse after the Acquisition is completed
We do not currently control Westinghouse and, after the closing of the acquisition, we will beneficially own 49% of 
Westinghouse, and Brookfield Renewable will beneficially own 51%. Until the acquisition closing, we cannot provide any 
assurance that Westinghouse will be operated in the same way that it would be operated under the control of us and 
Brookfield Renewable. Although we will have certain governance and approval rights in connection with our ownership interest 
in the partnership used for the acquisition (Acquisition Partnership) following the acquisition closing, we cannot provide any 
assurance that Westinghouse will be operated in the same way we would operate Westinghouse if we were its sole owner.
The liabilities of Westinghouse may exceed our estimates, and there may also be unknown or undisclosed liabilities 
in connection with the Acquisition
Westinghouse has various potential liabilities relating to the conduct of its business prior to the acquisition, including, but not 
limited to, potential liability for unfunded pension liabilities, liability for cleanup, decommissioning or remediation of 
environmental conditions, intellectual property disputes, and other potential liabilities that could adversely affect 
Westinghouse’s financial position. If the acquisition is completed, these potential liabilities could negatively impact the value of 
our investment in the Acquisition Partnership. Although we have conducted what we believe to be a sufficient level of 
investigation in connection with the acquisition, it is possible that the potential liabilities we have identified may exceed our 
expectations, and there may be liabilities that we failed to discover or were unable to quantify accurately or at all in our due 
diligence, which we conducted prior to the entry into the acquisition agreement. Only certain of these events may entitle the
purchaser to recourse under the acquisition agreement for such liabilities and contingencies. The discovery of any material 
liabilities, or the inability to obtain full recourse for such liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on our investment in the 
Acquisition Partnership and our ability to realize the benefits of the proposed acquisition.
In connection with the acquisition, the Acquisition Partnership and the general partner (each an Acquisition Entity) obtained 
representation and warranty coverage, with total limits of up to $800 million (US) above retention of 0.5% of the enterprise 
value. Nevertheless, this insurance policy is subject to certain exclusions and limitations. In addition, there may be 
circumstances for which the insurer may elect to limit such coverage or refuse to indemnify us or situations for which the 
coverage provided under the representation and warranty insurance policy may not be sufficient or applicable.
Certain defaults under specified Westinghouse credit facilities or an event of default under the Westinghouse credit 
facilities could result in the failure to complete the acquisition
Westinghouse has entered into various credit agreements with its lenders, pursuant to which it has incurred approximately 
$4.6 billion (US) in principal amount of indebtedness in the aggregate. A breach of certain covenants in the credit agreements 
governing Westinghouse’s credit facilities, or the occurrence of certain events, including certain change of control triggering 
events, may constitute an event of default. The closing of the acquisition is conditioned upon the absence of certain defaults 
under specified credit facilities of Westinghouse and its affiliates. The failure to satisfy any such condition could result in the 
failure to complete the acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on Westinghouse.
If an event of default exists under Westinghouse’s credit facilities, the lenders could declare all amounts outstanding 
thereunder to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on any pledged collateral. Westinghouse may not have access to 
sufficient funds at the time of any such acceleration to repay outstanding amounts under the credit agreements, or may be 
subject to contractual restrictions that may prohibit such repayments. This could have a material adverse effect on 
Westinghouse’s financial condition and on the Acquisition Partnership.
=====================================
2022 ANNUAL INFORMATION FORM Page 111
We cannot accurately predict the outcome of any litigation. The costs of defending or settling litigation can be significant. If a 
dispute cannot be resolved favourably, it may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial 
condition, results of operations, or prospects. See Legal proceedings on page 126 more information.
We are currently involved in a tax dispute with CRA and in 2017 settled a dispute with the IRS. See Transfer pricing dispute at 
pages 93 and 94. In addition, we are subject to the risk that CRA, the IRS or other tax authorities in other countries may seek to 
challenge or reassess our income tax returns on the same or a different basis for the same periods or other previously reported 
periods. Substantial success for CRA in the tax dispute would be material, and other unfavourable outcomes of challenges or 
reassessments initiated by the IRS or tax authorities in other countries could be material to our cash flows, financial condition, 
results of operations or prospects.
Joint ventures
We participate in McArthur River, Key Lake, Cigar Lake, Inkai, Millennium, and GLE through joint ventures with third parties, 
and, subject to closing, will participate in Westinghouse through a joint venture with third parties. Some of these joint ventures 
are unincorporated and some are incorporated (like JV Inkai, GLE and Westinghouse). We have other joint ventures and may 
enter more in the future.
There are risks associated with joint ventures, including:
• disagreement with a joint venture participant about how to develop, operate or finance a project
• a joint venture participant not complying with a joint venture agreement
• possible litigation or arbitration between joint venture participants about joint venture matters
• the inability to exert control over decisions related to a joint venture we do not have a controlling interest in
The other owner of JV Inkai is KAP, an entity majority owned by the government of Kazakhstan, so its actions and priorities 
could be dictated by government policies instead of commercial considerations.
These risks could result in legal liability, affect our ability to develop or operate a project under a joint venture, or have a 
material and adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Government laws and regulations
In addition to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, employee health and safety, and waste 
management (see Environmental risks), our business activities are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations in 
other areas.
There are laws and regulations for uranium exploration, development, mining, milling, refining, conversion, fuel manufacturing, 
transport, exports, imports, taxes and royalties, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection, and 
remediation of the environment, decommissioning and reclamation, safety, hazardous substances, emergency response, land 
use, water use and other matters.
Significant financial and management resources are required to comply with these laws and regulations, and this will likely 
continue as laws and government regulations become more and more strict. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of 
compliance or its effect on our business because legal requirements change frequently, are subject to interpretation, and may 
be enforced to varying degrees.
Some of our operations are regulated by government agencies that exercise discretionary powers conferred by statute. If these 
agencies do not apply their discretionary authority consistently, then we may not be able to predict the ultimate cost of 
complying with these requirements or their effect on operations.
Existing, new, or changing laws, regulations and standards of regulatory enforcement could disrupt transportation of our 
products, increase costs, lower, delay or interrupt production, or affect decisions about whether to continue with existing 
operations or development projects. This could have a material and adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial 
condition, results of operations, or prospects.
If we do not comply with the laws and regulations that apply to our business, or it is alleged we do not comply, then regulatory 
or judicial authorities could take any number of enforcement actions, including:
• corrective measures that require us to increase capital or operating expenditures or install additional equipment
=====================================
2022 ANNUAL INFORMATION FORM Page 123
• the filing of certain other applications and notices with, and receipt of the approvals, licences or consents from, other 
applicable governmental authorities.
We cannot provide any assurance that all necessary regulatory and other approvals will be obtained nor the timing of such 
approvals, nor can we provide any assurance that all of the other closing conditions will be satisfied or waived. The failure to 
obtain necessary approvals or the failure to satisfy some or all of the other required conditions could delay the acquisition 
closing for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Lawsuits or other legal proceedings brought in connection 
with the acquisition could also delay or prevent the acquisition closing, and may cause us to incur additional costs and divert 
management’s attention from the acquisition process and our core business operations. Any delay in obtaining the required 
approvals or satisfying the other closing conditions could reduce or eliminate the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or 
prevent the acquisition closing from occurring at all.
Failure to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition
Following the acquisition, we expect to see certain near-term benefits, including potential new revenue opportunities related to 
integrated fuel supply and improved access for uranium and conversion services, as well as longer-term opportunities for 
growth from new capacity. 
Any benefits and growth that we realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. In particular, our estimates 
of the potential benefits and growth from the acquisition are based in part on a valuation of Westinghouse that may differ from 
the performance of Westinghouse in the future.
In addition, any benefits that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in 
other expenses, including costs to achieve our estimated synergies and growth. Our plans for Westinghouse following the 
acquisition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time. 
We cannot provide any assurance that our initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be 
achieved on a timely basis or at all. Even if the acquisition is completed, it may take longer than expected to achieve the 
anticipated benefits and growth.
Failure to comply with nuclear licence and quality assurance requirements at certain Westinghouse facilities could 
result in costs, additional regulatory oversight and reputational risk
Westinghouse is a supplier of nuclear reactors, components, fuel and fuel handling equipment, maintenance and operating 
support services, and dismantling and decontamination services to the global nuclear power sector. Westinghouse and its 
affiliates maintain licences from nuclear regulatory authorities in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Spain to 
operate fuel fabrication facilities. These facilities are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny and any failure to comply with 
safety, security and quality assurances requirements at those facilities could result in increased regulatory oversight and civil 
penalties, as well as costs in remedying noncompliance and reputational risk.
In addition, enhanced safety or security requirements promulgated by these regulatory bodies could necessitate capital 
expenditures by Westinghouse. Significant non-compliance could result in revocation of certain of Westinghouse’s licenses.
Further, Westinghouse operates major nuclear component fabrication facilities in the United States and Italy. Components 
fabricated by Westinghouse at these facilities must comply with stringent quality requirements, including certifications under 
nuclear quality standards. Failure to adhere to these standards could result in liability under customer contracts, including
replacement of supplied components and potential exposure to litigation over nuclear power plant shutdowns resulting from 
defective components. Quality control issues at these facilities could also result in additional regulatory oversight and costs 
arising out of implementation of corrective actions. Any such adverse effects would negatively impact the acquisition and may 
adversely affect our business, financial results, and financial condition, as well as the price of our common shares.
Westinghouse’s comprehensive protections against liability for nuclear damage depend on the viability of global 
indemnities and continuation of nuclear liability regimes
Global nuclear liability regimes shield nuclear industry participants from unlimited exposure to nuclear accident risks and 
ensure compensation for victims of nuclear incidents. The US regime, based on the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries 
Indemnity Act, as amended, provides for “economic channeling” of liability by establishing requirements for nuclear reactor 
operators to maintain two layers of insurance (totaling approximately $14 billion (US)), which cover anyone potentially liable,
=====================================
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 27
Given our view that additional long-term supply will need to be incented to meet the growing demand for safe, clean, reliable, 
carbon-free nuclear energy, our preference today is to sign long-term contracts with market-related pricing mechanisms. 
Unsurprisingly, we believe our customers too expect prices to rise and prefer to lock-in today’s prices, with a fixed-price 
mechanism. Our goal is to balance all these factors, along with our desire for customer and regional diversification, with 
product form, and logistical factors to ensure we have adequate protection and will have exposure to rising market prices 
under our contract portfolio, while maintaining the benefits that come from having low-cost supply to deliver into a 
strengthening market. 
With respect to our existing contracts, at times we may also look for opportunities to optimize the value of our portfolio. In 
cases where there is a changing policy, operating, or economic environment, we may consider options that allow us to 
maintain our customer relationships and are mutually beneficial. 
CONTRACT PORTFOLIO STATUS 
We have commitments to sell approximately 180 million pounds of U3O8 with 34 customers worldwide in our uranium segment, 
and over 55 million kilograms as UF6 conversion with 31 customers worldwide in our fuel services segment. 
Customers – U3O8: 
Five largest customers account for 56% of commitments 
Customers – UF6 conversion: 
Five largest customers account for 59% of commitments 
Asia 19%

location of the project, this can be a complex and time-consuming process involving multiple government agencies. We also 
require governmental permits to export and transport our products.
Many approvals, licences and permits must be obtained from regulatory authorities and maintained, but there is no
assurance that they will grant or renew them, approve any additional licences or permits for potential changes to operations 
in the future or in response to new legislation, or that they will process any of the applications on a timely basis.
Stakeholders, like environmental groups, non-government organizations (NGOs) and Indigenous groups claiming rights to
traditional lands, can raise legal challenges. A significant delay in obtaining or renewing the necessary approvals, licences or
permits, or failure to receive the necessary approvals, licences or permits, could interrupt operations, or prevent them from 
operating, or disrupt the transportation and sale of our products, which could have a material and adverse effect on our
earnings, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
Public health issues and disease outbreaks
Our business and results of operations are subject to uncertainties arising out of public health issues. A local, regional, 
national, or international outbreak of an illness or contagious disease, such as a pandemic like COVID-19, could result in a 
general or acute decline in economic activity in the regions where our customers reside, where we operate in or hold assets 
in, production and transport delays, and general business interruptions. In addition, these risks could result in an increase in 
the cost of supplies and equipment, delays from difficulties in obtaining export or import licenses, tariffs and other barriers 
and restrictions, a decrease in the willingness of the general population to travel, staff shortages, mobility restrictions and 
other quarantine measures, supply shortages, increased government regulation, and the quarantine or contamination of one
or more of our operating sites or buildings. Any such events could have a material and adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
In 2020 and 2021, our operations were impacted because of precautionary production suspensions due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Production at Cigar Lake was suspended between March and September 2020, and for a subsequent period
between December 2020 and April 2021. 
There were disruptions to the supply chain worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2021 planned production from our fuel 
services operations was impacted by hydrogen supply issues.
Fuel fabrication defects and product liability
We fabricate nuclear fuel bundles, other reactor components, and monitoring equipment. These products are complex and 
may have defects that can be detected at any point in their product life cycle. Flaws in the products could materially and 
adversely affect our reputation, which could result in a significant cost to us and have a negative effect on our ability to sell
our products in the future. We could also incur substantial costs to correct any product errors, which could have an adverse
effect on our operating margins. While we have introduced significant automation to limit the potential for quality issues, there 
is no guarantee that we will detect all defects or errors in our products.
It is possible that some customers may demand compensation if we deliver defective products. If there are a significant 
number of product defects, it could have a significant impact on our operating results.
Agreements with some customers may include specific terms limiting our liability to customers. Even if there are limited 
liability provisions in place, existing or future laws, or unfavourable judicial decisions may make them ineffective. We have 
not experienced any material product liability claims to date, however, they could occur in the future because of the nature of 
nuclear fuel products. A successful product liability claim could result in significant monetary liability and could seriously 
disrupt our fuel manufacturing business and the company overall.
2 – Financial risks
Volatility and sensitivity to prices
We are concentrated in the nuclear fuel business, with our primary focus on uranium mining. As such, our earnings and cash 
flow are closely related to, and sensitive to, fluctuations in the spot and long-term market prices of U3O8 and uranium 
conversion services.
Many factors beyond our control affect these prices, including the following, among others:
=====================================
2023 THIRD QUARTER REPORT 21
As announced on October 11, 2022, we have entered into a strategic partnership with Brookfield and its publicly listed affiliate 
Brookfield Renewable Partners (Brookfield) and its institutional partners to acquire Westinghouse. Permanent financing is 
expected to be a mix of capital sources (cash, debt and equity), designed to preserve the company’s balance sheet and 
ratings strength while maintaining our liquidity. Please see Liquidity and capital resources starting on page 50 of our annual 
MD&A for more information. 
We expect our cash balances, operating cash flows, and the credit facilities put in place to support the close of the 
Westinghouse transaction, to meet our 2023 capital requirements. Depending on timing, we may have more or less cash than 
expected at closing and could temporarily draw on our revolving credit facility for short-term working capital purposes. 
We have large, creditworthy customers that continue to need our nuclear fuel products and services even during weak 
economic conditions, and we expect the contract portfolio we have built will continue to provide a solid revenue stream. In our
uranium segment, from 2023 through 2027, we have commitments to deliver an average of about 29 million pounds per year, 
with commitment levels in 2023 through 2025 higher than the average and in 2026 and 2027, lower than the average. 
We expect increased production at McArthur River/Key Lake compared to last year will be positive for cash flow as we are 
able to source more of our committed sales from lower-cost produced pounds and are no longer required to expense 
operational readiness costs directly to cost of sales. However, cash flow from operations for 2023 will be dependent on the 
timing and volume of production from McArthur River/Key Lake and Cigar Lake and the timing, magnitude and source of our 
purchasing activity. 
With the Supreme Court’s dismissal of CRA’s application for leave, the dispute for the 2003 through 2006 tax years is fully and
finally resolved in our favour. Furthermore, we are confident the courts would reject any attempt by CRA to utilize the same 
position and arguments for tax years 2007 through 2014, or its alternate reassessing position for tax years 2014 through 2016 
and believe CRA should return the remaining $483 million in cash and letters of credit we have been required to pay or 
otherwise secure. However, timing of any further payments is uncertain. See Transfer pricing dispute starting on page 15 for 
more information. 
CASH FROM/USED IN OPERATIONS
Cash provided by operations was $232 million higher this quarter than in the third quarter of 2022 due to higher earnings and a
decrease in working capital requirements, which required $109 million less in 2023 than in 2022. In addition to the higher 
earnings and decreased working capital requirements, interest received was $27 million more due to higher cash and 
investment balances and higher interest rates.
Cash provided by operations was $260 million higher in the first nine months of 2023 than for the same period in 2022 due to 
higher earnings, the $86 million cash refund from CRA, the higher dividend payment from JV Inkai and higher interest received 
due to higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates. These factors were partially offset by an increase in 
working capital requirements, which required $44 million more in 2023 than in 2022. See note 16 of our interim financial 
statements for more information.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
We use debt to provide additional liquidity. We have sufficient borrowing capacity with unsecured lines of credit totalling about 
$2.8 billion at September 30, 2023, up from $2.7 billion at June 30, 2023 due to a stronger US dollar. At September 30, 2023, 
we had approximately $1.5 billion outstanding in financial assurances, up from $1.4 billion at June 30, 2023 also due to a 
stronger US dollar. 
We have extended the maturity date of our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility from October 1, 2026, to October 1, 
2027. The credit facility allows us to request increases above $1.0 billion, in increments of no less than $50 million, up to a
total of $1.25 billion. At September 30, 2023, we had no short-term debt outstanding on our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving 
credit facility, unchanged from December 31, 2022. 
Long-term contractual obligations 
Since December 31, 2022, we have reclassified our Series G debentures to current since they mature on June 24, 2024. 
There have been no other material changes to our long-term contractual obligations. Please see our 2022 annual MD&A for 
more information.

TIM GITZEL:
Yes, Orest, I think we said we weren't going to be reporting on a quarterly basis. But Grant, you 
can speak to the (multiple speakers 27:02).
GRANT ISAAC:
Our normal process, Orest, you've been around this story for a long time. So you know that we 
would just add on an annual basis, talk about the uranium and conversion services that we had 
brought into our portfolio. We do that in sort of February in Q4. We undertook the practice of doing 
it quarterly, because we were seeing demand before others were and we just thought it was 
important for as we talked about demand coming to the market, we had to prove it. We were 
proving it by talking about our accepted and executed contracts.
But now we're seeing more broadly across the industry, and I just referenced it to Ralph, the 118 
million pounds that have been contracted already across the industry in the term market. The 
proof is out there. It no longer requires us to be showing that leading indicator and the market is 
in a very constructive spot. We think that demand is only going to continue to grow. We just 
stepped back from being the ones who were constantly showing what the demand formation was 
because the evidence is now there for everybody to see.
OREST WOWKODAW:
Okay. But clearly your book has increased again, just given that your 5-year average sales was 
increased to 28 million pounds from 26.
GRANT ISAAC:
Yes, absolutely. We always think about it, as you know, with respect to our portfolio, which is the 
committed sales we've already captured and our pipeline, which is the negotiations we have 
underway to capture value out into the future. I've been saying for some time now that pipeline is 
big. Despite the fact we've taken a lot of demand, translated into executed contracts, we still have 
a big pipeline. The replenishment of the demand into the pipeline continues to be very strong. 
That's what our marketing team is focused on. Those folks just do an incredible job negotiating 
the type of contracts that provide us with great upside participation in the market, really strong 
downside protection, should there be any macro headwinds, and that long tail of cash flow and
=====================================
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 51
We have large, creditworthy customers that continue to need our nuclear fuel products and services even during weak 
economic conditions, and we expect the contract portfolio we have built to continue to provide a solid revenue stream. In our 
uranium segment, from 2023 through 2027, we have commitments to deliver an average of 21 million pounds per year, with 
commitment levels in 2023 through 2025 higher than the average and in 2026 and 2027 lower than the average. 
We expect increased production at McArthur River/Key Lake will be positive for cash flow. It will allow us to source more of our 
committed sales from lower-cost produced pounds and we will no longer be required to expense operational readiness costs 
directly to cost of sales. However, cash flow from operations for 2023 will be dependent on the timing and volume of 
production and the timing and magnitude of our purchasing activity. 
We expect our cash balances and operating cash flows to meet our capital requirements during 2023. Depending on the 
timing of the close of the Westinghouse transaction, and the final financing mix of capital sources, cash balances could be 
lower or higher than expected. 
With the Supreme Court’s dismissal of CRA’s application for leave, the dispute of the 2003 through 2006 tax years are fully 
and finally resolved in our favour. Furthermore, we are confident the courts would reject any attempt by CRA to utilize the 
same or similar positions and arguments for the other tax years currently in dispute (2007 through 2014) and believe CRA 
should return the $778 million in cash and letters of credit we have been required to pay or otherwise secure. As such, we 
have filed notice of appeal to the Tax Court however, timing of any further payments is uncertain. See page 44 for more 
information.

Subsoil law
Amendments to the old subsoil law in 2007 allow the government to reopen resource use contracts in certain circumstances, 
and in 2009, the Kazakhstan government passed a resolution that classified 231 blocks, including Inkai’s blocks, as strategic 
deposits. The Kazakhstan government re-approved this list in 2011 and in 2018 and Inkai’s blocks remain on it. These actions 
may increase the government’s ability to expropriate JV Inkai’s properties in certain situations. In 2009, at the request of the 
Kazakhstan government, JV Inkai amended the resource use contract to adopt a new tax code, even though the government 
had agreed to tax stabilization provisions in the original contract.
The previous subsoil use law which went into effect in 2010 weakened the stabilization guarantee of the prior law and the 
current subsoil code contains a significant number of provisions which apply retrospectively. These developments reflect 
increased political risk in Kazakhstan.
Nationalization
Industries like mineral production are regarded as nationally or strategically important, but there is no assurance they will
not be expropriated or nationalized. Government policy can change to discourage foreign investment and nationalize
mineral production, or the government can implement new limitations, restrictions, or requirements.
There is no assurance that our investment in Kazakhstan will not be nationalized, taken over or confiscated by any authority
or body, whether the action is legitimate or not. While there are provisions for compensation and reimbursement of losses to 
investors under these circumstances, there is no assurance that these provisions would restore the value of our original 
investment or fully compensate us for the investment loss. This could have a material and adverse effect on our earnings,
cash flows, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
Government regulations
Our investment in Kazakhstan may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations restricting production, price 
controls, export controls, currency controls, taxes and royalties, expropriation of property, environmental, mining and safety 
legislation, and annual fees to maintain mineral properties in good standing. Kazakhstan regulatory authorities exercise 
considerable discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of local laws and regulations. At times, authorities use this 
discretion to enforce rights in a manner that is inconsistent with relevant legislation, particularly with respect to licence 
issuance, renewal, and compliance. Requirements imposed by regulatory authorities may be costly and time-consuming
and may result in delays in the commencement, continuation, or expansion of production operations. Regulatory authorities
may impose more onerous requirements and obligations than those currently in effect.
There is no assurance that the laws in Kazakhstan which provide protection to investments, including foreign investments,
will not be amended, or abolished, or that these existing laws will be enforced or interpreted to provide adequate protection 
against any or all of the risks described above. There is also no assurance that the resource use contract can be enforced or 
will provide adequate protection against any or all the risks described above.
See pages 62 to 65 for a more detailed discussion of the regulatory and political environment in Kazakhstan.
Presidential succession and recent instability
The President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, was in office since Kazakhstan became an independent republic in
1991 until he resigned on March 20, 2019. He was succeeded by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Subsequently Kazakhstan began
to experience some instability.
In early January 2022, Kazakhstan saw the most significant instability since it became independent in 1991. The events 
resulted in a state of emergency being declared across the country. With the assistance of the Collective Security Treaty 
Organization (CSTO), the government restored order and in the second half of January, the state of emergency was
gradually lifted and withdrawal of CSTO forces from Kazakhstan was completed. The early outcome of those events was a
number of political and economic reforms declared by the government. While the exact impact of those reforms is unclear,
they could potentially impact JV Inkai’s operations and costs. In November 2022, President Tokayev was re-elected for a 
new 7-year term.
There is considerable uncertainty regarding the future political and economic landscape in Kazakhstan, which could have
a material and adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

2022 ANNUAL INFORMATION FORM Page 124
including suppliers, for nuclear damage. International global nuclear liability regimes under the 1963 Vienna Convention on 
Civil Liability, as amended by the 1997 Protocol; the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy 
and the Brussels Supplementary Convention; and the 1997 Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage 
provide for legal channeling of liability to the operator of a nuclear installation.
While these nuclear liability regimes shield nuclear suppliers and service providers from nuclear damage in the specific 
jurisdiction in which a nuclear incident occurs, radioactive releases can be transboundary, and there is no single global nuclear 
liability regime. Only approximately 70 countries are party to an existing liability regime, and not all the regimes are 
interconnected. This exposes suppliers to potential liability in jurisdictions not party to a nuclear liability regime. In addition, 
nuclear liability regimes cover only offsite nuclear damage and do not apply to property damage to the plant itself or any 
equipment onsite, which typically is covered by separate insurance maintained by nuclear operators.
To address these gaps, Westinghouse obtains from its customers global indemnities against nuclear damage as well as 
waivers of any onsite property damage. However, should an existing nuclear liability regime be repealed in any country, should 
any such indemnity be insufficient or should a customer become unable to act on an indemnity due to a bankruptcy or other 
financial hardship, Westinghouse could be exposed to claims in the event of a nuclear incident.
Westinghouse operates in a politically sensitive environment, and the public perception of nuclear energy can affect 
Westinghouse’s customers and Westinghouse
Westinghouse’s business involves providing products and services for the nuclear industry, which is a politically sensitive 
environment. Opposition by third parties to particular projects, including in connection with any incident involving the potential 
discharge of radioactive materials, could affect Westinghouse and its customers’ businesses. Adverse public reaction could 
also lead to increased regulation, limitations on the activities of Westinghouse and Westinghouse’s customers, more onerous 
operating requirements or other conditions that could have a material adverse impact on Westinghouse and its customers.
Nuclear power plant operations are also potentially subject to disruption by a nuclear accident. A future accident at a nuclear 
reactor anywhere in the world could result in the shutdown of existing plants or impact the continued acceptance by the public 
and regulatory authorities of nuclear energy and the future prospects for nuclear generators, each of which could have a 
material adverse impact on Westinghouse.
Furthermore, accidents, terrorism, natural disasters or other incidents occurring at nuclear facilities or involving shipments of 
nuclear materials or technological changes could reduce the demand for nuclear products and services. All of these risks 
could adversely impact our operations and our investment in Westinghouse after the acquisition.
Threat of increased nuclear trade barriers could have an adverse impact on Westinghouse’s business
The nuclear energy industry is global and also susceptible to nuclear trade controls due to the sensitive nature of nuclear 
technologies, equipment and material and the importance of nuclear energy to national security. The ability of Westinghouse 
to conduct business globally is dependent on its ability to maintain and secure new licenses for the export of nuclear 
technology, equipment, and materials. 
While licences are not always required, there are certain nuclear exports and destinations for those exports that are subject to 
stringent licensing requirements. For example, Westinghouse’s continued ability to sell services and equipment to reactors in
China is dependent on its existing specific authorization under applicable law. In case of geopolitical circumstances that would 
result in sanctions on China, this specific authorization would be limited or terminated, negatively impacting the business.
A future major nuclear accident or disaster could have a negative effect on our and Westinghouse’s operations
Due to their inherent materiality, major accidents in the nuclear industry, and most notably at nuclear power plants garner 
significant worldwide attention and spawn global public sentiment favouring more significant regulation for nuclear power 
generation. Westinghouse has various contracts in place with Energoatom, Ukraine’s national nuclear power company and 
actively carries on business in the country. The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had and continues to have a
negative impact on Westinghouse’s operations in Ukraine, resulting in loss of revenue and corresponding loss of earnings. 
Furthermore, certain nuclear power plants are located in the disputed territory.
A major accident at a nuclear power plant, or a similar disaster related to the nuclear industry, including as a result of the 
military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could lead to more countries adopting increasingly stringent safety regulations in

Our business 
Our vision is to energize a clean-air world. We have a more than 30-year 
proven track record of providing secure and reliable nuclear fuel supplies 
to a global customer base to generate safe, reliable, and affordable
carbon-free energy. Nuclear energy plants around the world use our 
uranium products to generate one of the cleanest sources of electricity 
available today. 
Our operations span the nuclear fuel cycle from exploration to fuel services, 
which include uranium production, refining, UO2 and UF6 conversion 
services and CANDU fuel manufacturing for heavy water reactors. To meet 
our customers’ growing demand for nuclear fuel supplies and services that 
are reliable and secure, we have also made investments, that if successful, we expect will allow us to participate in the entire 
nuclear fuel value chain, adding capabilities in enrichment; fuel fabrication for light water reactors; reactor maintenance and 
other services; the design, engineering, and support for the development of new reactors; and nuclear sustainability services.
With extraordinary assets, a proven operating track record, long-term contract portfolio, strong ESG commitment, employee 
expertise, comprehensive industry knowledge, and a strong balance sheet, the company is making investments that it expects 
will create a platform for strategic growth. We are confident in our ability to increase long-term growth by positioning the 
company as one of the global leaders in supporting the clean energy transition at a time when the world’s prioritization of 
decarbonization and energy security is driving growth in demand and when geopolitics are creating concerns about the origin 
and security of supplies across the nuclear fuel cycle.

Westinghouse’s operations are exposed to occupational health and safety and accident risks
Some of the tasks undertaken by Westinghouse’s employees and contractors are inherently dangerous and have the potential 
to result in serious injury or death. Accordingly, Westinghouse’s operations are exposed to the risk of accidents that may give 
rise to personal injury, loss of life, disruption to service and economic loss, including, for example, resulting from related 
litigation.
Westinghouse is subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing health and safety matters, which differ in the 
jurisdictions in which Westinghouse operates. Any violation of these obligations, or serious accidents involving Westinghouse’s 
employees, contractors or members of the public, could expose Westinghouse or its operating businesses to adverse 
regulatory consequences, including the forfeiture or suspension of its operating licences, potential litigation, claims for material 
financial compensation, reputational damage, fines or other legislative sanctions, which may materially and adversely impact 
Westinghouse’s financial condition.
Risks to our business associated with entry into the strategic partnership with Brookfield Renewable
Although we have certain rights pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement between us and Brookfield Renewable with regards to 
the governance of the Acquisition Partnership general partner, including the right to designate directors of the boards of 
directors of the general partner and certain material subsidiaries of the Acquisition Entities, our beneficial ownership in the 
strategic partnership entities will be 49%, whereas Brookfield Renewable will beneficially own 51%, and the directors are 
entitled to weighted voting corresponding to the designating shareholder’s proportionate equity interest. Consequently, other 
than in the case of certain reserved matters expressly set out in the governance agreement, Brookfield Renewable has the 
power to control the strategic partnership entities. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that the strategic partnership 
entities will be operated in the same way they would have been operated if we were the sole owner.
Following the acquisition closing, we expect that the strategic partnership entities will, to the greatest extent possible, be 
funded by their own cash flows and third-party funding. Pursuant to the governance agreement, to the extent a strategic 
partnership entity requires additional capital to meet a funding shortfall for certain approved activities, if approved as a 
reserved matter, the Acquisition Partnership may make equity funding requests to us and Brookfield Renewable, on a pro rata
basis on the basis of our and Brookfield Renewable’s respective equity interests in the Acquisition Entities. Failure by us to 
meet such an equity funding request would not constitute a default under the governance agreement, but in the event that 
Brookfield Renewable elects to participate in the equity financing and we do not, our interest in the Acquisition Partnership 
may be diluted. There can be no assurance that we or Brookfield Renewable will have the necessary capital resources to meet 
an equity funding request if and when made by the Acquisition Partnership. In the event that the Acquisition Partnership 
cannot raise the necessary funds from us or Brookfield Renewable or otherwise obtain adequate required capital on favorable 
terms or at all, it may be required to scale back or entirely halt any operating or expansion plans and its business, financial 
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Further, disputes may arise between us and Brookfield Renewable that may adversely affect the success of the strategic 
partnership entities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial performance. Our 
failure to otherwise comply with our obligations under the governance agreement may result in us being in default under the 
governance agreement and could result in us losing some or all of our interest in the Acquisition Partnership.

It was clear the major suppliers are not prepared to take the risk of expanding or bringing on new 
capacity without long-term contracts to support their investments.
I've been around this industry for a long time and involved in every one of the new uranium 
projects developed in the Athabasca Basin in Northern Saskatchewan since the late 1970s. Let 
me tell you from experience, bringing on a new project anywhere is not easy, despite some of the 
promises being made by those who have never done it. Today, the calls to increase uranium 
conversion and enrichment capacity are happening in a complex global environment.
An environment where supply chain issues, general inflation, skilled labour limitations, rising 
interest rates, and increasing regulations and ESG standards are not making it easier or cheaper 
to build new assets or even operate existing assets.
In addition to production challenges, let's not forget the geopolitical uncertainties are leading to 
concerns about origin of supply. Some utilities are seeking to exclude Russia in their future 
contracting decisions, and there's always the ongoing risk of formal sanctions. Then tied to the 
origin risk, there was a recent reminder that moving nuclear material around the globe to various 
points in the fuel cycle is also more difficult than it once was.
