It is apparent that revenues from its  operations in the U.S. continue to make up a major portion  of its total revenues, at approximately 50%. The remaining  50% comes from other countries such as China (11.7%),  Japan (3.8%), and Germany (3.0%).     Source: MSFT  2021 10K8 Intelligent Cloud   More and more companies are embarking on digital  transformation to improve efficiency, optimize operations  and attract more customers, creating a strong impetus for  the growth of the intelligent cloud sector. Microsoft\\'s  cloud business benefits from three economies of scale:  data centers with very small uni t costs; data centers that  can meet the needs of different models with efficient  resource utilization; and low application maintenance  costs.8  The main business of the Intelligent Cloud Division are:   \\\\u2022 Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server and other server  produ cts and cloud services.   \\\\u2022 Enterprise services including advanced support and  consulting services.8  In 2021, Intelligent Cloud contributed 35.74% of total  revenue, ranking first among the three operating  segments.1 In the first quarter of 2022, the segment\\'s  revenue grew 31% compared to the same period last year,  with server products and cloud services revenue driven by  Azure\\'s revenue growth, up 35%.10  The following chart  illustrates our forecast for this  segment of the business over the next five years. Based on  the strong performance of Azure and other cloud services,  we expect its revenue to grow by 2 1.18 % next year and by  an average of 20.28 % over the next five years.1    Source:  Henry Fund Model1  More Personal Computing   The More Personal Computing division puts the customer  at the heart of the experience and aims to make  36% 32%32%2021 Revenue Decomposition by Segments Intelligent Cloud More Personal Computing Productivity & Business Processes 50% 50%2021 Revenue Decomposition by Geography  United States  Other Countries 5.00%10.00%15.00%20.00%25.00% 25.0050.0075.00100.00125.00150.00Intelligent Cloud Revenue Growth Rate\", \"Page 3     computing more personal with more intuitive and  engaging interactions.

In  particular, Windows OEM revenue grew 10%, Windows  Commercial Products and Cloud Services revenue grew  12%, Xbox -related revenue grew 2%, and advertising  revenue grew 40%, but Surface -related revenue declined  17%.10  The next chart shows our anticipation for this segment  through fiscal year 2026.  We are positive about Windows  11, which officially launc hed on October 5, 2021, and  believe it will spur revenue growth from Windows -related  commercial products and services. We expect its revenue  to grow by 1 3.52 % in the coming year and by an average  of 13.13 % over the next five years, the most modest of the  three segments.1    Source:  Henry Fund Model1  Productivity & Business Processes   The Productivity and Business Processes segment covers  products and services related to productivity,  communications, and information services, specifically :  \\\\u2022 Subscription -based o r locally licensed Office  commercial, including Office, Exchange, Microsoft  Team s, Skype for business, etc.8 \\\\u2022 Subscriptions or local licenses for Office consumers,  similarly, cover Office, Skype, Outlook, OneDrive, etc.8  \\\\u2022 LinkedIn, which contain s Talent, Marketing, Sales, and  Learning Solutions, as well as Premium Subscriptions.8  \\\\u2022 Includes a set of Dynamics business solutions across  ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, etc. based on cloud or  local applications.8  For fiscal 2021, the Productivity and Business  Processes  segment contributed 32.1% of total revenue, ranking third  among the three operating segments by a narrow margin.1  According to its FY 2022 Q1 earnings report, this segment\\'s  revenue increased by 22% compared to the same period  last year. The fou r sub-divisions  mentioned above grew by  23%, 10%, 42%, and 48%, respectively, driven by growth in  cloud services revenue and growth in marketing  solutions.10  The chart  below shows our expectations for this segment  over the next five years.

According  to their 10K,  the increase in  total cost of revenue in 2021 is related to growth in the  commercial cloud and gaming businesses.  The chart below  shows our estimates for its annual growth rate, which we  expect to decrease and gradually stabilize at around 1 5%.

In 2021, the R&D expenses were $20.7 billion, an increase  of 7.5% over last year. According to Microsoft, this was  brought about by investments in cloud engineering.8  Since R&D expenses are critical to the growth of software  industry players, we believe that Microsoft will continue to  invest more in R&D for the foreseeable fu ture to facilitate  the growth of its cloud services. As shown in the chart  below, we expect R&D expenses to grow by 15.2% in 2022,  with an average annual growth rate of 16.49% through the  end of fiscal 2026.1   Source:  Henry Fund Model1  Sales & Marketing   Microsoft\\'s sales and marketing expenses cover expenses  such as salaries, which are determined by the number of  employees, and expenses such as advertising and  promotion.

It was up 2.6% over last year, boosted by  investment in commercial sales.8  As illustrated in the chart below, based on Microsoft\\'s  guidance, we expect to see sales and marketing expenses  grow by 21.39% in fiscal year 2022, with annual growth  rates gradually slowing to a steady rate of around 18.36%  thereafter.1    Source:  Henry Fund Model1  In 2021, Microsoft\\'s gross and operating margins received  a positive foreign exchange impact of 3% and 4%,  respectively, but it is u ncertain whether this trend will  continue.

Our  model reflects these conditions well, with gross and  operating margins expected to be slightly lower in 2022  than last year.1 However, we believe that Microsoft\\'s  industry position is unshakeable, and its strong drive to  launch dozens or even hundr eds of new products every  year is enough to support its stable gross and operating  margins in the face of fierce competition.

Although COVID -19 made  certain expenses larger, com bined with its gross margin  (+1.14%) and operating margin (+4.56%) changes, overall,  we do not believe it had a material adverse impact on  Microsoft.1, 3  During the pandemic, Microsoft worked to ensure  employee well -being by modifying employee travel  polic ies, closing offices, and allowing non -essential  employees to work remotely. Service providers who  charge by the hour can continue to be paid. The existing  Microsoft CARES employee assistance program was  expanded.8  According to the company\\'s guidance, the instability  caused by the outbreak could adversely affect the  following activities :  \\\\u2022 Maintenance of operational infrastructure to meet the  stability and capacity requirements of cloud services .  \\\\u2022 Maintaining stable int ernational business es.  \\\\u2022 Ability to hire the required workforce8  ACQUISITIONS   Microsoft has frequent acquisition activity, which is  common for an industry giant like it. The software industry  is fast -paced, and product development cycles are key, so  acquirin g new technology or expanding existing product  lines through acquisition is often more attractive than  developing them in -house.3  In December 2020, Microsoft acquired Smashgg, Inc. for  an undisclosed amount to expand its gaming -related  services.2  In March 2021, Microsoft acquired Marsden Group for  undisclosed terms to enhance its ability to create  customer value with solutions based on Microsoft\\'s cloud,  edge, and artificial intelligence offerings.2  In March 2021, Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media, Inc .,  the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC, one of the  world\\'s largest privately held game developers and  publishers, for $8.1 billion.2  In April 2021, Microsoft announced the acquisition of  Nuance Communications, Inc., a software provider with  both a rtificial intelligence and healthcare experience, for  $19.7 billion. This is the largest deal in Microsoft\\'s history  after the acquisition of LinkedIn. Microsoft is trying to  build a healthcare cloud.2\", \"Page 7     In May 2021, Microsoft acquired Kinvolk GmbH for an  undisclosed price to enhance each other\\'s services and  growth opportunities.2  In June 2021, Microsoft acquired ReFirm Labs, Inc. for an  undisclosed price to provide silicon and cybersecurity.2  In July 2021, Microsoft acquired RiskIQ for undisclosed  terms to enhance cybersecurity.2  In July 2021, Microsoft acquired CloudKnox Security, Inc.  for an undisclosed amount to further expand its security  business.2  In July 2021, Microsoft acquired Suplari for undisclosed  terms to enhance business optimization capabiliti es.2  In our view, there is no doubt that such frequent and  aggressive acquisitions by Microsoft will provide a strong  impetus to its growth and help it expand its product line  and solidify its position in the industry.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION   Cloud -based software development tools   Programmers are as important to the software industry as  gasoline is to a car. Today, more and more programmers  tend to use Web -based collaboration tools to share or  modify code because it reduces the amount of time  programmers need to develop or test software. Pandemic  restrictions are causing more and more employees to work  from home, and with the growing use of open -source  software, there is a growing demand for such  collaboration tools. GitHub, which Microsoft prev iously  acquired, is the world\\'s largest provider of collaborative  code hosting, with more than 27 million users since 2008.13  Open -Source Software   As we just mentioned, open -source software has become  increasingly popular in the last decade. The rapid grow th  of this type of software, which has source code that can be  freely modified and redistributed, poses an alternative  threat to the software industry based on traditional  licensing models.13     Porter\\\\u2019s Five Forces   Threat of New Entrants ( High)  According to CFRA Software industry survey, on average,  dozens of new software companies are formed every day.  On the one hand, software is the most preferred choice of  venture capital in the information technology industry.  This is because of its short de velopment cycle, which can  see results in as little as a few weeks, while semiconductor  companies take years to achieve; on the other hand, the  rapid growth of the software industry also brings rich  returns for venture capitalists, and they complement and  reinforce each other. Its rapid growth is attracting more  investors, and more and more investment is attracting  entrepreneurs who want a slice of the pie. On balance, we  believe that the threat from new entrants is relatively  high.3  Threat of Substitutes ( Moderate)   We believe that the threat from substitutes in the  Software industry is moderate. Complete replacement of  existing software poses immeasurable and unpredictable  risks for consumers or businesses, so complete or rapid  replacement is uncommon. Howe ver, near replacement or  gradual obsolescence is very common, and existing  vendors will need to update or transition existing  software, such as moving from local client -server  applications to cloud -based programs. In addition, vendors  also need to face int ense competition in the industry, as  we mentioned before.3  Bargaining Power of Suppliers  (Moderate)   In the Software industry, the bargaining power of suppliers  is unique. On the one hand, the design and construction of  software do not require physical raw materials. However,  skilled workers or engineers with design and development  skills are pivotal to the growth of a company. Smaller  companies seem to have a more difficult time attracting or  retaining these talents, as large companies offer terms of  employ ment that are difficult for smaller companies to  match. Therefore, taken together, we believe that the  bargaining power of suppliers is m oderate .3  Bargaining Power of Customers  (Low)   Based on our research, we believe that customer\", \"match. Therefore, taken together, we believe that the  bargaining power of suppliers is m oderate .3  Bargaining Power of Customers  (Low)   Based on our research, we believe that customer  bargaining power in the software industry is moderate.  Since most of the revenue comes from enterprise\", \"Page 8     customers, their influence is very significant. However,  their influence is also limited by specific mark et segments,  and the demand for specific software from companies.  These specific dependencies can also affect the loyalty of  that customer to different applications.3  Intensity of Rivalry (High)   We believe that competition within the software industry  is fierce. Regardless of whether it is run through traditional  license sales and maintenance models or subscription - based payment and cloud delivery models, the entire  product cycle speed in the software industry is no less than  that of the fashion industry, a nd the cost of mistakes is  very high due to the increasingly important role it plays in  running businesses. In addition, major players such as  Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM account for over 80% of the  industry\\'s combined revenue. However, the increasing  numbe r of new entrants and the rapidly changing market  share percentages all indicate that, on average, the level  of competition within the Software industry is intense but  healthy.3  Peer Comparisons   Players in the software industry compete on various  fronts, s uch as brand awareness and price. While most of  the industry\\'s revenue comes from corporate customers,  the spending power of individual consumers cannot be  ignored, and they are more price conscious than  corporations. Operators focused on meeting the needs  of  enterprise consumers have had to differentiate between  enterprise and individual customer use of software,  allowing them to charge higher prices for the former. But  it must be said that the rise of open -source downloads and  cloud -based software has inc reased competition in the  industry, and consumers are no longer focused on  comparing prices, but tend to look for free alternatives. In  addition, the industry is becoming increasingly global, with  a growing share of revenue coming from international  custom ers.4  Based on our research and Microsoft\\'s latest earnings  report, we learned that its main competitors are Apple Inc.   (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. ( FB),  Amazon.com, Inc.  (AMZN), International Business  Machines Corporation  (IBM), salesforce.com, inc. (CRM),  Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), and Zoom Video  Communications, Inc.  (ZM).  Because these companies   operate  different industry segments, we did not present their industry market share percentages; instead, as  shown in the tabl e below, we compared their market  capitalization, revenue from the software industry, and  revenue from the software industry as a percentage of  total revenue.  This table is based on a descending order of  industry revenue.   In terms of market capitalization,  Apple and Microsoft are  far ahead of the pack, as they have taken the lead in the  over $2 trillion market cap category. They are followed by  Google and Amazon, which are also approaching this  value, and IBM and Zoom, which are relatively small. In  terms o f industry revenue, there is no doubt that Google  and Microsoft are the industry leaders, with similar  industry revenue of about $150 billion. Cisco and Zoom\\'s  industry revenues are relatively low among their peers, at  $6 billion and $3 billion respectivel y. This is  understandable since Cisco only generates about 11% of  its revenue from the software industry. On the other hand,  Zoom is the youngest of these companies, with the  pandemic providing the impetus for its growth.

As global vaccination rates steadily increase, we expect  steady economic development,  IT spending, and a return  to pre -pandemic growth rates in the software industry.3    Source: CFRA Software Industry Survey3  Overall Software Industry Revenue Forecasts   In 2020, the sudden outbreak had a significant impact on  the software industry, whose total industry revenue  growth was only 1.8%, which was a 7.3% slowdown  compared to the previous year. The chart below shows a  comparison between the software industry\\'s traditional  license maintenance revenue and cloud subscription  revenue. For the f irst time in a decade, we saw a decline in  traditional model revenue, down about 4.1%. This was  offset by a strong 20.7% increase in cloud subscriptions  and did not affect the upward trend in total software  industry revenue.3  According to CFRA, total softw are industry revenue will  grow by 6.4% in 2021. As pent -up demand is unleashed  and cloud -based products and services are updated and  upgraded, we expect to see increased pricing power for vendors to follow.

We believe the DDM is solid because Microsoft has a long  history of steady dividend payments and their dividend s  per share  increase d year over year.   Relati ve Valuation Model   We ultimately did not use the target price given by this  model because we believe the average P/E ratio of the  peers does not truly reflect Microsoft, and most of the  peers have lower P/E ratios than it. Microsoft\\'s P/E ratio is  expected  to be 35.31 in 2022, while peers\\' expected P/E  ratios fluctuate between 13 -83. In comparison, we believe  Microsoft\\'s stock is overvalued compared to most of its  peers.1  SUMMARY   All in all, we believe Microsoft\\'s position as an industry  leader with a diver se product line and attractive margins  will be difficult to catch up with. However, Henry Fund has  currently overweighted the IT industry, exceeding the  market weight by 2.83 %. The holding in Microsoft also  exceeds the S&P 500 by 0.88 % and there is no need  to add  to the position for a potential 7.96% upside, so I  recommend holding Microsoft.   We need to keep a close eye on interest rates to determine  if it is continuing to pick up. For a giant like Microsoft,  which frequently and heavily engages in acquisiti ons,  rising interest rates are significantly detrimental to  business.   We also need to watch for Microsoft Cloud, by which  Microsoft has been given a very strong start to fiscal 2022.  Whether such momentum remains strong, and how long it  can last, will guid e Microsoft\\'s growth after that.   REFERENCES   1. Henry Fund Model   2. FactSet   3. CFRA Industry Survey: Software  4.

Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category de\\\\ufb01nitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft. Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment to Sustainability We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that bene\\\\ufb01t the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect\", \"and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint. Fiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due in substantial part to signi\\\\ufb01cant global datacenter expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won\\\\u2019t always be linear.\", \"PART I Item 1   While fiscal year 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we also made some great progress. A few examples that illuminate the diversity of our work include:   \\\\u2022 We purchased the removal of 1.4 million metrics tons of carbon.   \\\\u2022 Four of our datacenters received new or renewed Zero Waste certifications.   \\\\u2022 We granted $100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions the world needs to reach net- zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.   \\\\u2022 We joined the First Movers Coalition as an early leader and expert partner in the carbon dioxide removal sector, with a commitment of $200 million toward carbon removal by 2030. Sustainability is an existential priority for our society and businesses today. This led us to create our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their operations. We also joined with leading organizations to launch the Carbon Call \\\\u2013 an initiative to mobilize collective action to solve carbon emissions and removal accounting challenges for a net zero future. The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services and datacenters help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity We are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees\\\\u2019 communities, and beyond. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025.   \\\\u2022 Strengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black and African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.   \\\\u2022 Evolving our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster societal change and create new opportunities.   \\\\u2022 Increasing representation and strengthening inclusion: build on our momentum, adding a $150 million investment to strengthen inclusion and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx leaders in the United States by 2025. Over the last year, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and programs, including: working with 70 organizations in 145 communities on the Justice Reform Initiative, expanding access to a\\\\ufb00ordable broadband and devices for Black and African American communities and key institutions that support them in major urban centers, expanding access to skills and education to support Black and African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support for nonpro\\\\ufb01ts that provide critical services to Black and African American communities. We have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. We are 90 percent of the way to our 2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S., and 50 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S. We exceeded our goal on increasing the percentage of transaction volumes with Black- and African American-owned \\\\ufb01nancial institutions and increased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, enabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we\", \"our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, enabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, reaching more than 90 percent of our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black and African American- owned suppliers. We also increased the number of identi\\\\ufb01ed partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative and continue to invest in the partner community through the Black Channel Partner Alliance by supporting events focused on business growth, accelerators, and mentorship. Progress does not undo the egregious injustices of the past or diminish those who continue to live with inequity. We are committed to leveraging our resources to help accelerate diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem and to hold ourselves accountable to accelerate change \\\\u2013 for Microsoft, and beyond.\", \"PART I Item 1   Investing in Digital Skills The COVID-19 pandemic led to record unemployment, disrupting livelihoods of people around the world. After helping over 30 million people in 249 countries and territories with our global skills initiative, we introduced a new initiative to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater \\\\ufb02exibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certi\\\\ufb01cation opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn\\\\u2019s Economic Graph. We previously invested $20 million in key non-pro\\\\ufb01t partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people from underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy. We also launched a national campaign with U.S. community colleges to help skill and recruit into the cybersecurity workforce 250,000 people by 2025, representing half of the country\\\\u2019s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation\\\\u2019s public community colleges, providing training for new and existing faculty at 150 community colleges, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work, where they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As of June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 122,000 in the U.S. and 99,000 internationally. Of the total employed people, 85,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 73,000 were in product research and development; 47,000 were in sales and marketing; and 16,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our Culture Microsoft\\\\u2019s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. We believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious \\\\u2013 trying new things without fear of failure. We identi\\\\ufb01ed four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish:   \\\\u2022 Obsessing over what matters to our customers.   \\\\u2022 Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do.   \\\\u2022 Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses.   \\\\u2022 Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us. Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Seventy percent of employees globally participated in our \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 Employee Signals survey, which covers a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and development. Throughout the \\\\ufb01scal year, we collect over 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During \\\\ufb01scal year 2022, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing racial injustice, the war in Ukraine, and their general wellbeing. In addition to Employee Signals and Daily Pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership, performance and development, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and\", \"through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership, performance and development, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support.\", \"PART I Item 1   Diversity and Inclusion At Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact economies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a di\\\\ufb00erent set of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access to opportunity and achievement. The better we represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower. We strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace and workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance to be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as LGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our  2021 Proxy Statement , annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including:   \\\\u2022 Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our business.   \\\\u2022 Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).   \\\\u2022 Disability representation.   \\\\u2022 Pay equity (see details below). Total Rewards We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly di\\\\ufb00erentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. As part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, in fiscal year 2021 we expanded stock eligibility to all Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and equivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. In response to the Great Reshu\\\\ufb04e, in \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 we announced a sizable investment in annual merit and annual stock award opportunity for all employees below senior executive levels. We also invested in base salary adjustments for our datacenter and retail hourly employees and hourly equivalents outside the U.S. These investments have supported retention and help to ensure that Microsoft remains an employer of choice. Pay Equity In our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts in the U.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our twelve other largest employee geographies representing 86.6% of our global population (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) combined earn $1.001 for every $1.000 by men in these countries. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellness and Safety\", \"by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellness and Safety Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees\\\\u2019 well-being and safety while they are at work and in their personal lives. We took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now supporting employees in shifting to return to o\\\\ufb03ce and/or hybrid arrangements. We developed hybrid guidelines for managers and employees to support the transition and continue to identify ways we can support hybrid work scenarios through our employee listening systems.\", \"PART I Item 1   We have invested signi\\\\ufb01cantly in holistic wellbeing,   and  o\\\\ufb00er a di\\\\ufb00erentiated  bene\\\\ufb01ts package  which  includes many physical, emotional, and \\\\ufb01nancial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program,  mental wellbeing support,  \\\\ufb02exible \\\\ufb01tness bene\\\\ufb01ts, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders.  Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working. We continue to strive to support our Ukrainian employees and their dependents during the Ukraine crisis with emergency relocation assistance, emergency leave, and other benefits. Learning and Development Our growth mindset culture begins with valuing learning over knowing \\\\u2013 seeking out new ideas, driving innovation, embracing challenges, learning from failure, and improving over time. To support this culture, we o\\\\ufb00er a wide range of learning and development opportunities. We believe learning can be more than formal instruction, and our learning philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the right way. Opportunities include:   \\\\u2022 Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on both our internal learning portal Learning (Viva Learning + LinkedIn Learning) and our external learning portal MS Learn are available to all employees worldwide.   \\\\u2022 In-the-classroom learning, learning cohorts, our early-in-career Aspire program, and manager excellence communities.   \\\\u2022 Required learning for all employees and managers on topics such as compliance, regulation, company culture, leadership, and management. This includes the annual Standards of Business Conduct training.   \\\\u2022 On-the-job \\\\u201cstretch\\\\u201d and advancement opportunities.   \\\\u2022 Managers holding conversations about employees\\\\u2019 career and development plans, coaching on career opportunities, and programs like mentoring and sponsorship.   \\\\u2022 Customized manager learning to build people manager capabilities and similar learning solutions to build leadership skills for all employees including differentiated leadership development programs.   \\\\u2022 New employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, and culture, as well as ongoing onboarding programs.   \\\\u2022 New tools to assist managers and employees in learning how to operate, be productive, and connect in the new \\\\ufb02exible hybrid world of work. These include quick guides for teams to use, such as Creating Team Agreements, Reconnecting as a Team, and Running E\\\\ufb00ective Hybrid Meetings. Our employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as thousands of informal and on-the-job learning opportunities. In terms of formal on-line learning solutions, in \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 our employees completed over 4.7 million courses, averaging over 14 hours per employee. Given our focus on understanding core company beliefs and compliance topics, all employees complete required learning programs like Standards of Business Conduct, Privacy, Unconscious Bias, and preventing harassment courses. Our corporate learning portal has over 100,000 average monthly active users. We have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between 20-33 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned ongoing required training each year. In addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession they are in each year. New Ways of Working The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to \\\\ufb02exible work. We introduced a Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that shift paradigms, embrace \\\\ufb02exibility, promote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value the \\\\ufb02exibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many have\", \"innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value the \\\\ufb02exibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many have begun returning to worksites as conditions have permitted, they also continue to adjust hours and/or spend some of workweeks working at home, another site, or remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of workstyles where individuals, teams, and our business can deliver success.\", \"PART I Item 1   OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business and report our \\\\ufb01nancial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is e\\\\ufb00ectively positioned against, and uniquely di\\\\ufb00erentiated from, competitive products and services based on signi\\\\ufb01cant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. OPERATIONS We have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Paci\\\\ufb01c region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa. To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to re\\\\ufb02ect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.   \\\\u2022 Cloud and AI , focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and e\\\\ufb03cient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.   \\\\u2022 Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including O\\\\ufb03ce, Windows, Teams,  con sumer web experiences (including search and news advertising), and the Surface line of devices.   \\\\u2022 Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management , focuses on cloud platform and application security, identity and network access,\", \"\\\\u2022 Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management , focuses on cloud platform and application security, identity and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.     \\\\u2022 Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development e\\\\ufb00orts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.   \\\\u2022 LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.   \\\\u2022 Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.\", \"PART I Item 1   Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product di\\\\ufb00erentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modi\\\\ufb01cations and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may a\\\\ufb00ect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make signi\\\\ufb01cant modi\\\\ufb01cations to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 69,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of speci\\\\ufb01c patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees\\\\u2019 products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental e\\\\ufb00orts, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Investing in the Future Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe o\\\\ufb00er signi\\\\ufb01cant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems. While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We plan to continue to make signi\\\\ufb01cant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the Company.\", \"coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the Company.  In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world\\\\u2019s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation. DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.\", \"PART I Item 1   OEMs We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365. There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (\\\\u201cEnterprise Agreement Software Advisors\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cESA\\\\u201d). Microsoft o\\\\ufb00ers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales. We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In \\\\ufb01scal year 2021, we closed our Microsoft Store physical locations and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries. Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (\\\\u201cLSP\\\\u201d), distributors, value-added resellers (\\\\u201cVAR\\\\u201d), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support. Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. LICENSING OPTIONS We o\\\\ufb00er options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use di\\\\ufb00erent programs designed to provide \\\\ufb02exibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may di\\\\ufb00er in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.\", \"various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing bene\\\\ufb01ts to help customers deploy and use software e\\\\ufb03ciently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.\", \"PART I Item 1   Volume Licensing Programs Enterprise Agreement Enterprise Agreements o\\\\ufb00er large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the \\\\ufb02exibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included. Microsoft Customer Agreement A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simpli\\\\ufb01ed purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital experience. A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft. Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement A Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is   designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. Microsoft Products and Services Agreement Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses. Open Value Open Value agreements are a simple, cost-e\\\\ufb00ective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included. Select Plus A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any a\\\\ufb03liate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Partner Programs The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program o\\\\ufb00ers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value- added services o\\\\ufb00ered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the uni\\\\ufb01ed business solution to their end users.\", \"PART I Item 1   CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.\", \"PART I Item 1   INFORMATION ABOUT OUR  EXECUTIV E OFFICERS Our executive officers as of July 28, 2022 were as follows:   Name   Age     Position with the Company         Satya Nadella     54     Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Judson Althoff     49     Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Christopher C.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and \\\\ufb01nancial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely a\\\\ufb00ect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversi\\\\ufb01ed global companies with signi\\\\ufb01cant research and development resources to small, specialized \\\\ufb01rms whose narrower product lines may let them be more e\\\\ufb00ective in deploying technical, marketing, and \\\\ufb01nancial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates bene\\\\ufb01cial network e\\\\ufb00ects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing signi\\\\ufb01cant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face signi\\\\ufb01cant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.   \\\\u2022 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single \\\\ufb01rm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance bene\\\\ufb01ts from their vertically integrated o\\\\ufb00er. We also o\\\\ufb00er some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.   \\\\u2022 We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face signi\\\\ufb01cant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more di\\\\ufb03cult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services o\\\\ufb00ered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (\\\\u201cOEM\\\\u201d) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.   \\\\u2022 Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and signi\\\\ufb01cant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our\", \"content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. E\\\\ufb00orts to compete with competitors\\\\u2019 content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors\\\\u2019 rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.   \\\\u2022 Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, o\\\\ufb00setting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.   \\\\u2022 Other competitors develop and o\\\\ufb00er free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.   \\\\u2022 Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These \\\\ufb01rms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.  A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with arti\\\\ufb01cial intelligence (\\\\u201cAI\\\\u201d). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors in\\\\ufb02uence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\\\\u2019s choice of which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting signi\\\\ufb01cant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things (\\\\u201cIoT\\\\u201d). Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our o\\\\ufb00erings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We may not establish market share su\\\\ufb03cient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:   \\\\u2022 Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.   \\\\u2022 Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.   \\\\u2022 Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.   \\\\u2022 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.   \\\\u2022\", \"\\\\u2022 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.   \\\\u2022 Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not e\\\\ufb00ective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase e\\\\ufb03ciency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate su\\\\ufb03cient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.\", \"PART I Item 1A   RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS We make signi\\\\ufb01cant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.  We will continue to make signi\\\\ufb01cant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, O\\\\ufb03ce, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, O\\\\ufb03ce 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and e\\\\ufb00ective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest o\\\\ufb00erings as providing signi\\\\ufb01cant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably a\\\\ufb00ecting revenue. We may not achieve signi\\\\ufb01cant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be pro\\\\ufb01table, and even if they are pro\\\\ufb01table, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Signi\\\\ufb01cant delays in new releases or signi\\\\ufb01cant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse e\\\\ufb00ect on our business.  We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in  March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a de\\\\ufb01nitive agreement to acquire  Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $68.7 billion.   These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve signi\\\\ufb01cant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have di\\\\ufb03culty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies\\\\u2019 ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full bene\\\\ufb01ts from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced e\\\\ufb03ciencies, or the bene\\\\ufb01ts may ultimately be smaller than we expected.

If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a signi\\\\ufb01cant charge to earnings.  We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic bene\\\\ufb01t from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash \\\\ufb02ow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a signi\\\\ufb01cant charge in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.\", \"PART I Item 1A   CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\\\\u2019 or customers\\\\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy signi\\\\ufb01cant resources to plan and carry out exploits. Nation-state attacks against us or our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed con\\\\ufb02ict, such as the ongoing con\\\\ufb02ict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to con\\\\ufb01dential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\\\\u2019 security or systems or reveal con\\\\ufb01dential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving   and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the di\\\\ufb03culty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise con\\\\ufb01dential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. The cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as \\\\u201cSolorigate\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cNobelium\\\\u201d are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider\\\\u2019s customers, including us, through software updates. The attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers\\\\u2019 systems. We may be targets of further attacks similar to Solorigate/Nobelium as both a supplier and consumer of IT. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Security of our products, services, devices, and customers\\\\u2019 data The security of our products and services is important in our customers\\\\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services   across cloud and on- premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also a\\\\ufb00ect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their e\\\\ufb00orts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\\\\u2019 on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\\\\u201czero day\\\\u201d) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers\\\\u2019 systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users\\\\u2019 accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\\\\u2019s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers\\\\u2019 vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when de\\\\ufb01ning default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. Cyberattacks such as Solorigate/Nobelium may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an\", \"able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\\\\u2019 computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\\\\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as \\\\ufb01rewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as \\\\ufb01nancial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services.\", \"PART I Item 1A   The cost of  measures to protect products and customer-facing services  could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely a\\\\ufb00ect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure   to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.  As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based o\\\\ufb00erings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-pro\\\\ufb01le data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our e\\\\ufb00orts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our e\\\\ufb00orts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our \\\\ufb02exibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others\", \"We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own bene\\\\ufb01t, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be in\\\\ufb02uenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively a\\\\ufb00ected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Other digital  safety  abuses Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and con\\\\ufb02icting legal frameworks. When discovered by users, such content may negatively a\\\\ufb00ect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks.  To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including AI. The IoT\\\\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ine\\\\ufb00ective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and \\\\ufb01rmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly a\\\\ufb00ect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm or liability . We are building AI into many of our o\\\\ufb00erings, including our productivity services, and we are also making \\\\ufb01rst- and third-party AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could a\\\\ufb00ect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be \\\\ufb02awed. Datasets may be insu\\\\ufb03cient or contain biased information. Ine\\\\ufb00ective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These de\\\\ufb01ciencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (\\\\u201cEU\\\\u201d), and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or o\\\\ufb00er AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm. OPERATIONAL RISKS We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.  Our increasing user tra\\\\ufb03c, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We\", \"infrastructure.  Our increasing user tra\\\\ufb03c, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more tra\\\\ufb03c on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on predictable energy and networking supplies, the cost or availability of which could be adversely a\\\\ufb00ected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Ine\\\\ufb03ciencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insu\\\\ufb03cient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\", \"PART I Item 1A   We  may experience quality or supply problems.  Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we  design  and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur signi\\\\ufb01cant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions   and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magni\\\\ufb01es the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and \\\\ufb01x in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can a\\\\ufb00ect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.  As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. The European Commission (\\\\u201cthe Commission\\\\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as \\\\ufb01le formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive signi\\\\ufb01cant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with speci\\\\ufb01cations for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we o\\\\ufb00ered to address the Commission\\\\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in\", \"concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and \\\\ufb01le formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products. Our portfolio of \\\\ufb01rst-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners o\\\\ufb00er a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in \\\\ufb01nes or hinder our ability to provide the bene\\\\ufb01ts of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come s  from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:   \\\\u2022 We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid \\\\ufb01nes or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely.   \\\\u2022 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not re\\\\ufb02ect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property.   \\\\u2022 We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial \\\\ufb01nes or other remedial actions.   \\\\u2022 Our ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.   \\\\u2022 Regulatory scrutiny may inhibit our ability to consummate acquisitions or impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of such transactions. Our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\\\\u201cFCPA\\\\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\\\\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\\\\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in di\\\\ufb00erent forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also a\\\\ufb00ect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from o\\\\ufb00ering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in speci\\\\ufb01ed countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply\", \"certain entities in speci\\\\ufb01ed countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed con\\\\ufb02ict, such as the ongoing con\\\\ufb02ict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services o\\\\ufb00erings include  requirements related to  user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection,  advertising,  and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that our o\\\\ufb00erings such as   Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws , including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code,  are de\\\\ufb01ning more of our services as regulated telecommunications services.  This trend may continue and will result in these o\\\\ufb00erings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations.   Regulators  may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer  data  and other  information  is inconsistent with their laws and regulations ,   including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies . Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative  and  regulatory action  is emerging  in the area s  of AI and content moderation,  which could increase  costs or  restrict  opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may con\\\\ufb02ict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments\\\\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve signi\\\\ufb01cant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, \\\\ufb01nes against us, or reputational damage.  The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some EU data protection authorities blocking the use of U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. The U.S. and the EU in March 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the Privacy Shield, called the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. A failure of the U.S. and EU to \\\\ufb01nalize the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers. Potential new rules and restrictions on the \\\\ufb02ow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\\\\u201cGDPR\\\\u201d) applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services o\\\\ufb00ered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling\", \"from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services o\\\\ufb00ered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering e\\\\ufb00orts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our o\\\\ufb00erings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR makes our o\\\\ufb00erings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties (of up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), private lawsuits, reputational damage,   blockage of international data transfers,   and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling or transfer of personal data.\", \"PART I Item 1A   The Company\\\\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational e\\\\ufb03ciency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational e\\\\ufb03ciency. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, a\\\\ufb00ecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced e\\\\ufb03ciency, or greater di\\\\ufb03culty in competing with foreign-based \\\\ufb01rms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or o\\\\ufb00er certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in signi\\\\ufb01cant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.  We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, signi\\\\ufb01cant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in signi\\\\ufb01cant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely a\\\\ufb00ect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\\\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties.  We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal \\\\ufb01nes and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We may have additional tax liabilities.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Signi\\\\ufb01cant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\\u201cTCJA\\\\u201d) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements, and the exercise of signi\\\\ufb01cant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future\", \"the exercise of signi\\\\ufb01cant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may di\\\\ufb00er from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in di\\\\ufb00erent jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more di\\\\ufb03cult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The \\\\ufb01nal resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may di\\\\ufb00er from the amounts recorded in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements and may materially a\\\\ufb00ect our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a signi\\\\ufb01cant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with di\\\\ufb00ering statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher e\\\\ufb00ective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\\\\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\", \"PART I Item 1A   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.  Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely a\\\\ufb00ect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property.  Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is di\\\\ufb03cult. While piracy adversely a\\\\ufb00ects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more signi\\\\ufb01cant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more di\\\\ufb03cult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the bene\\\\ufb01ts of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemni\\\\ufb01cation bene\\\\ufb01ts for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. We expend signi\\\\ufb01cant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more di\\\\ufb03cult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, or the di\\\\ufb03culty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.  From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our o\\\\ufb00ering of \\\\ufb01rst-party devices, such as Surface. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign a\\\\ufb00ected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemni\\\\ufb01cation commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides\", \"services, or pay damages to satisfy indemni\\\\ufb01cation commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plainti\\\\ufb00s can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid signi\\\\ufb01cant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. GENERAL RISKS If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands a\\\\ufb00ect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability,   supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product o\\\\ufb00ering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:   \\\\u2022 The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.\", \"PART I Item 1A     \\\\u2022 Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.   \\\\u2022 Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.  Worsening economic conditions, including in\\\\ufb02ation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely a\\\\ufb00ect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that a\\\\ufb00ect global \\\\ufb01nancial markets. A signi\\\\ufb01cant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global \\\\ufb01nancial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely a\\\\ufb00ected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely a\\\\ufb00ect our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.  A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a signi\\\\ufb01cant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed con\\\\ufb02ict, such as the ongoing con\\\\ufb02ict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in a\\\\ufb00ected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in a\\\\ufb00ected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that\", \"disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and pro\\\\ufb01tability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic such as COVID-19 may adversely a\\\\ufb00ect our operations, \\\\ufb01nancial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, \\\\ufb01nancial markets, and business practices. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals\\' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Measures to contain  a global pandemic   may  intensify  other risks described in these Risk Factors. Any of these  measures   may adversely impact our ability to:   \\\\u2022 Maintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services.   \\\\u2022 Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such as through datacenter load balancing.   \\\\u2022 Ensure a high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations.   \\\\u2022 Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies.   \\\\u2022 Hire and deploy people where we most need them.   \\\\u2022 Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution functions. We may incur increased costs to e\\\\ufb00ectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term e\\\\ufb00ects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may a\\\\ufb00ect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.  Our customers are located throughout the world and a signi\\\\ufb01cant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be a\\\\ufb00ected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, in\\\\ufb02ation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and di\\\\ufb03culties in sta\\\\ufb03ng and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends   and concerns about human rights and political expression in speci\\\\ufb01c countries may signi\\\\ufb01cantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tari\\\\ufb00s, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more di\\\\ufb03cult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, signi\\\\ufb01cant \\\\ufb02uctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.  Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees   representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the \\\\ufb02ow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately sta\\\\ufb00 our\", \"laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the \\\\ufb02ow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately sta\\\\ufb00 our research and development e\\\\ufb00orts. If we are less successful in our recruiting e\\\\ufb00orts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure e\\\\ufb00ective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is primarily non-unionized, but we have several unions and works councils outside of the United States. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. While Microsoft has not received such petitions in the U.S., the unionization of signi\\\\ufb01cant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\", \"PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4     ITEM 1B.

OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most signi\\\\ufb01cant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. Highlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included:   \\\\u2022 Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2 billion.   \\\\u2022 Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 18%.   \\\\u2022 Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 59.7 million.   \\\\u2022 LinkedIn revenue increased 34%.   \\\\u2022 Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 39%.   \\\\u2022 Server products and cloud services revenue increased 28% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 45%.   \\\\u2022 Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\\\\u201cWindows OEM\\\\u201d) revenue increased 11%.   \\\\u2022 Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11%.   \\\\u2022 Xbox content and services revenue increased 3%.   \\\\u2022 Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 27%.   \\\\u2022 Surface revenue increased 3%. On March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (\\\\u201cNuance\\\\u201d) for a total purchase price of $18.8 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Nuance is a cloud and arti\\\\ufb01cial intelligence (\\\\u201cAI\\\\u201d) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-speci\\\\ufb01c cloud o\\\\ufb00erings. The \\\\ufb01nancial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 \\\\u2013 Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements  ( Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K ) for further discussion. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of\", \"conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\", \"PART II Item 7   Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and in\\\\ufb02uence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\\\\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain quali\\\\ufb01ed employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by o\\\\ufb00ering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\\\u2019s career across many di\\\\ufb00erent products and businesses, and competitive compensation and bene\\\\ufb01ts. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few quali\\\\ufb01ed suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term \\\\ufb02exibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our international operations provide a signi\\\\ufb01cant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may signi\\\\ufb01cantly a\\\\ufb00ect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in \\\\ufb01scal year 2022. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue \\\\ufb02uctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our \\\\ufb01scal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Reportable Segments We report our \\\\ufb01nancial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 \\\\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Metrics We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and re\\\\ufb02ect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Interest and dividends income decreased due to lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities.

INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our e\\\\ufb00ective tax rate for \\\\ufb01scal years 2022 and 2021 was 13% and 14%, respectively. The decrease in our e\\\\ufb00ective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax bene\\\\ufb01t in the \\\\ufb01rst quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, o\\\\ufb00set in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax bene\\\\ufb01ts in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellent Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\\u201cTCJA\\\\u201d) regulations. In the \\\\ufb01rst quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax bene\\\\ufb01t in the \\\\ufb01rst quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax bene\\\\ufb01t of $620 million in the third quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2021 to re\\\\ufb02ect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016. Our e\\\\ufb00ective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net income tax bene\\\\ufb01t related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our e\\\\ufb00ective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In \\\\ufb01scal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion. In \\\\ufb01scal year 2021, our U.S. income before income taxes was $35.0 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.1 billion.\", \"PART II Item 7   Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\\\\u201cIRS\\\\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in \\\\ufb01scal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in \\\\ufb01scal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in \\\\ufb01scal year 2018. In the second quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. As of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a \\\\ufb01nal resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a signi\\\\ufb01cant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP \\\\ufb01nancial measures which exclude the net tax bene\\\\ufb01t related to the transfer of intangible properties in the \\\\ufb01rst quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 and the net income tax bene\\\\ufb01t related to an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2021. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends a\\\\ufb00ecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP \\\\ufb01nancial results in evaluating business performance.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $104.8 billion and $130.3 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Equity investments were $6.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade \\\\ufb01xed-income securities, diversi\\\\ufb01ed among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our \\\\ufb01xed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our \\\\ufb01xed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain \\\\ufb01xed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our \\\\ufb01nancial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certi\\\\ufb01cates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying signi\\\\ufb01cant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more re\\\\ufb02ective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classi\\\\ufb01ed as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying signi\\\\ufb01cant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a su\\\\ufb03cient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period \\\\ufb02uctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Income Taxes As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the \\\\ufb01rst \\\\ufb01ve years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $6.2 billion, which included $1.5 billion for \\\\ufb01scal year 2022. The remaining transition tax of $12.0 billion is payable over the next four years, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months. Provisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became e\\\\ufb00ective on July 1, 2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the U.S. tax return over \\\\ufb01ve or \\\\ufb01fteen years, depending on where research is conducted. The final foreign tax credit regulations, also effective on July 1, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the U.S. tax return. While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our \\\\ufb01scal year 2023 e\\\\ufb00ective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes. Share Repurchases During \\\\ufb01scal years 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for $28.0 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs.

The acquisition has been approved by  Activision Blizzard\\\\u2019s  shareholders, and we expect it to close  in fiscal  year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative sta\\\\ufb00.

We have operating and \\\\ufb01nance leases for datacenters, corporate o\\\\ufb03ces, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1 \\\\u2013 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a\\\\ufb00ect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a signi\\\\ufb01cant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our \\\\ufb01nancial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require signi\\\\ufb01cant judgment. When a cloud- based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily O\\\\ufb03ce 365, depend on a signi\\\\ufb01cant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from O\\\\ufb03ce 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\\\\u201cSSP\\\\\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using\", \"In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the strati\\\\ufb01cation of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various bene\\\\ufb01ts from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\", \"PART II Item 7   Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated  at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires signi\\\\ufb01cant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider speci\\\\ufb01c adverse conditions related to the \\\\ufb01nancial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to bene\\\\ufb01t from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a signi\\\\ufb01cant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identi\\\\ufb01cation of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash \\\\ufb02ow methodology. This analysis requires signi\\\\ufb01cant judgments, including estimation of future cash \\\\ufb02ows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially a\\\\ufb00ect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs\", \"factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially a\\\\ufb00ect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\", \"PART II Item 7   Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to signi\\\\ufb01cant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\\\\u2019s \\\\ufb01nancial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax bene\\\\ufb01ts recognized in the \\\\ufb01nancial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classi\\\\ufb01cation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased e\\\\ufb03ciencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be e\\\\ufb00ective beginning \\\\ufb01scal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, it is estimated this change will increase our \\\\ufb01scal year 2023 operating income by $3.7 billion. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\", \"PART II Item 7     STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\\\\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements and related information that are presented in this report.

\"PART II Item 8     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 \\\\u2014 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles Our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\\\u201cGAAP\\\\u201d). We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing \\\\ufb01nancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a\\\\ufb00ect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\\\\u201cSSP\\\\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\\\\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased e\\\\ufb03ciencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well   as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from  four years  to  six years . This change in accounting estimate will be e\\\\ufb00ective beginning \\\\ufb01scal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated   useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. Revenue   Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as O\\\\ufb03ce 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\", \"PART II Item 8   Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that re\\\\ufb02ects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and di\\\\ufb00er mainly in the duration over which the customer bene\\\\ufb01ts from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (\\\\u201cSA\\\\u201d). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more e\\\\ufb03ciently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive bene\\\\ufb01ts, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a signi\\\\ufb01cant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is  generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 \\\\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require signi\\\\ufb01cant judgment. When a cloud- based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\", \"based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily O\\\\ufb03ce 365, depend on a signi\\\\ufb01cant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from O\\\\ufb03ce 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\", \"PART II Item 8   Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the strati\\\\ufb01cation of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various bene\\\\ufb01ts from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may di\\\\ufb00er from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, O\\\\ufb03ce 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other o\\\\ufb00erings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 13 \\\\u2013 Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.  In instances where the timing of revenue recognition di\\\\ufb00ers from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a signi\\\\ufb01cant \\\\ufb01nancing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simpli\\\\ufb01ed and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive \\\\ufb01nancing from our customers or to provide customers with \\\\ufb01nancing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $ 1.0  billion and $ 965\", \"recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $ 1.0  billion and $ 965  million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 3.8  billion and $ 3.4  billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts re\\\\ufb02ects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience,  and  other currently available evidence.\", \"PART II Item 8   Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:    (In millions)                                                                             Year Ended June 30,     2022       2021       2020                       Balance, beginning of period   $ 798     $ 816     $ 434   Charged to costs and other     157       234       560   Write-offs     ( 245 )     ( 252 )     ( 178 )                                               Balance, end of period   $ 710     $ 798     $ 816                               Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:   (In millions)                                                                             June 30,     2022       2021       2020                       Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts   $ 633     $ 751     $ 788   Other long-term assets     77       47       28                                                 Total   $ 710     $ 798     $    816                               We record \\\\ufb01nancing receivables when we o\\\\ufb00er certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services o\\\\ufb00erings through a \\\\ufb01nancing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, our \\\\ufb01nancing receivables, net were $ 4.1  billion and $ 4.4  billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the bene\\\\ufb01t of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\\\\u201cOEM\\\\u201d), to drive tra\\\\ufb03c to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of ful\\\\ufb01lling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of speci\\\\ufb01c product failures (if any). The speci\\\\ufb01c hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate\", \"we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug \\\\ufb01xes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.\", \"PART II Item 8   Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee bene\\\\ufb01ts, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee bene\\\\ufb01ts, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 1.5  billion, $ 1.5  billion, and $ 1.6  billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\\\\u201cRSUs\\\\u201d) and performance stock units (\\\\u201cPSUs\\\\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\\\\u201cESPP\\\\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and \\\\ufb01nancial statements in the same year. The tax e\\\\ufb00ect of such temporary di\\\\ufb00erences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax bene\\\\ufb01t will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classi\\\\ufb01ed as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classi\\\\ufb01ed as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\", \"PART II Item 8   Debt  investments are classi\\\\ufb01ed as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the speci\\\\ufb01c identi\\\\ufb01cation method. Changes in fair value, excluding  credit losses and  impairments, are recorded in  other comprehensive income .  Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost.  To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider speci\\\\ufb01c adverse conditions related to the \\\\ufb01nancial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If  we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery , then  a decline in fair value  below cost is recorded as  an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are su\\\\ufb03cient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with o\\\\ufb00setting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of e\\\\ufb00ectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash \\\\ufb02ow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:   \\\\u2022 Level 1  \\\\u2013 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.   \\\\u2022 Level 2  \\\\u2013 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all signi\\\\ufb01cant inputs are\", \"markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all signi\\\\ufb01cant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash \\\\ufb02ows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certi\\\\ufb01cates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset- backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over- the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\", \"PART II Item 8     \\\\u2022 Level 3  \\\\u2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically re\\\\ufb02ect management\\\\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash \\\\ufb02ow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities  include  investments in  corporate notes  and  bonds ,  municipal securities , and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use,  three  to  seven  years ; computer equipment,  two  to  four  years ; buildings and improvements,  five  to  15  years ; leasehold improvements,  three  to  20  years ; and furniture and equipment,  one  to  10  years . Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\\\\u201cROU\\\\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill\", \"portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\", \"PART II Item 8   Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of bene\\\\ufb01t, ranging from one  to  20  years . We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Accounting for Income Taxes In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis di\\\\ufb00erences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance also simpli\\\\ufb01es aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clari\\\\ufb01es the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. We adopted the standard e\\\\ufb00ective July 1, 2021. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2 \\\\u2014 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (\\\\u201cEPS\\\\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the e\\\\ufb00ect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and e\\\\ufb03ciently managing the economic impact of these exposures as e\\\\ufb00ectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Interest Rate Interest rate risks related to certain \\\\ufb01xed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\", \"PART II Item 8   Securities held in our \\\\ufb01xed-income portfolio are subject to di\\\\ufb00erent interest rate risks based on their maturities. We  manage the average maturity of our \\\\ufb01xed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based \\\\ufb01xed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts .  These contracts  are  not  designated as hedging instruments   and are included in \\\\u201cOther contracts\\\\u201d in the tables below. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \\\\u201cOther contracts\\\\u201d in the tables below. Credit Our \\\\ufb01xed-income portfolio is diversi\\\\ufb01ed and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversi\\\\ufb01cation. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \\\\u201cOther contracts\\\\u201d in the tables below. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0  billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2022, our long-term unsecured debt rating was  AAA , and cash investments were in excess of $ 1.0  billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $ 620  million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year  1996  through fiscal year  2016 .   The decrease from the federal statutory rate in \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax bene\\\\ufb01t related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax bene\\\\ufb01ts relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in \\\\ufb01scal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax bene\\\\ufb01ts relating to stock-based compensation, and tax bene\\\\ufb01ts from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in \\\\ufb01scal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax bene\\\\ufb01ts relating to stock-based compensation. In \\\\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated  71 %,  82 %, and  86 % of our foreign income before tax.

In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The decrease in our e\\\\ufb00ective tax rate for \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 compared to \\\\ufb01scal year 2021 was primarily due to a $ 3.3  billion net income tax bene\\\\ufb01t in the \\\\ufb01rst quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, o\\\\ufb00set in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax bene\\\\ufb01ts in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and \\\\ufb01nal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\\u201cTCJA\\\\u201d) regulations. The decrease in our e\\\\ufb00ective tax rate for \\\\ufb01scal year 2021 compared to \\\\ufb01scal year 2020 was primarily due to tax bene\\\\ufb01ts from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, \\\\ufb01nal TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\", \"PART II Item 8   The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:     (In millions)                                         June 30,   2022     2021         Deferred Income Tax Assets                       Stock-based compensation expense   $ 601     $ 502   Accruals, reserves, and other expenses     2,874       2,960   Loss and credit carryforwards     1,546       1,090   Amortization     10,656       6,346   Leasing liabilities     4,557       4,060   Unearned revenue     2,876       2,659   Other     461       319                                       Deferred income tax assets     23,571       17,936   Less valuation allowance     ( 1,012 )     ( 769 )                                     Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance   $ 22,559     $ 17,167                                       Deferred Income Tax Liabilities                       Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt   $ ( 174 )   $ ( 2,381 ) Leasing assets     ( 4,291 )     ( 3,834 ) Depreciation     ( 1,602 )     ( 1,010 ) Deferred tax on foreign earnings     ( 3,104 )     ( 2,815 ) Other     ( 103 )     ( 144 )                                     Deferred income tax liabilities   $ ( 9,274 )   $ ( 10,184 )                                     Net deferred income tax assets   $ 13,285     $ 6,983                           Reported As                       Other long-term assets   $ 13,515     $ 7,181   Long-term deferred income tax liabilities     ( 230 )     ( 198 )                                     Net deferred income tax assets   $ 13,285     $ 6,983                         Deferred income tax balances re\\\\ufb02ect the e\\\\ufb00ects of temporary di\\\\ufb00erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.

In the second quarter of \\\\ufb01scal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years  2004  to  2013  and made a payment of $ 1.7  billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years  2004  to  2017 . As of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a \\\\ufb01nal resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a signi\\\\ufb01cant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996  to  2021 , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We expect to recognize approximately  45 % of this revenue over the next  12  months and the remainder thereafter.

In 2019, the SAMR presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China\\\\u2019s Anti-Monopoly Law. Product-Related Litigation U.S. Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits \\\\ufb01led in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plainti\\\\ufb00s who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health e\\\\ufb00ects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia\\\\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were \\\\ufb01led in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health e\\\\ufb00ect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\\\\u201cFCC Guidelines\\\\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plainti\\\\ufb00s allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into e\\\\ufb00ect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plainti\\\\ufb00s\\\\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of \\\\ufb02awed scienti\\\\ufb01c methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\\\\u2019 motion to exclude the plainti\\\\ufb00s\\\\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants \\\\ufb01led an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scienti\\\\ufb01c evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 expert reports.  A hearing  on general causation  is  scheduled for September of 2022 . Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\\\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ 364  million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $ 600  million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements for the period in which the e\\\\ufb00ects become reasonably estimable.\", \"PART II Item 8   NOTE 16  \\\\u2014  STOCKHOLDERS\\\\u2019 EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:   (In millions)                                 Year Ended June 30,   2022     2021     2020           Balance, beginning of year     7,519       7,571       7,643   Issued     40       49       54   Repurchased     ( 95 )     ( 101 )     ( 126 )                                         Balance, end of year     7,464       7,519       7,571                             Share Repurchases On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 40.0  billion in share repurchases.

However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may bene\\\\ufb01t other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a pro\\\\ufb01t margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments bene\\\\ufb01t and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the \\\\ufb01nancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \\\\ufb01nancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signi\\\\ufb01cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the \\\\ufb01nancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \\\\ufb01nancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the \\\\ufb01nancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\", \"PART II Item 8     Revenue Recognition \\\\u2013 Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that re\\\\ufb02ects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company o\\\\ufb00ers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following:   \\\\u2022 Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.     \\\\u2022 The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.     \\\\u2022 Identi\\\\ufb01cation and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).     \\\\u2022 Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately.   Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit e\\\\ufb00ort in evaluating management\\'s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company\\'s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following:   \\\\u2022 We tested the e\\\\ufb00ectiveness of controls related to the identi\\\\ufb01cation of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.     \\\\u2022 We evaluated management\\'s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.     \\\\u2022 We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:     - Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.     - Tested management\\'s identification and treatment of contract terms.     - Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management\\'s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.     \\\\u2022 We evaluated the reasonableness of management\\'s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.     \\\\u2022 We tested the mathematical accuracy of management\\'s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.\", \"PART II Item 8     Income Taxes \\\\u2013 Uncertain Tax Positions \\\\u2013 Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company\\'s long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (\\\\\"IRS\\\\\"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company\\'s \\\\ufb01nancial statements. Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve signi\\\\ufb01cant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management\\'s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit e\\\\ufb00ort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management\\'s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:   \\\\u2022 We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management\\'s methods and assumptions used in the identi\\\\ufb01cation, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.     \\\\u2022 We read and evaluated management\\'s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.     \\\\u2022 We tested the reasonableness of management\\'s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.     \\\\u2022 For those uncertain tax positions that had not been e\\\\ufb00ectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.     \\\\u2022 We evaluated the reasonableness of management\\'s estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management\\'s judgments.     /s/  D ELOITTE  & T OUCHE  LLP   Seattle, Washington July 28, 2022   We have served as the Company\\'s auditor since 1983.\", \"PART II Item 9, 9A     ITEM 9.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive O\\\\ufb03cer and Chief Financial O\\\\ufb03cer, we have evaluated the e\\\\ufb00ectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive O\\\\ufb03cer and Chief Financial O\\\\ufb03cer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting for the Company. Internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our \\\\ufb01nancial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly re\\\\ufb02ect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material e\\\\ufb00ect on our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the e\\\\ufb00ectiveness of our internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting based on the framework in  Internal Control \\\\u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company\\\\u2019s internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting was e\\\\ufb00ective as of June 30, 2022. There were no changes in our internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that have materially a\\\\ufb00ected, or are reasonably likely to materially a\\\\ufb00ect, our internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting as of June 30, 2022; their report is included in Item 9A.\", \"PART II Item 9A     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the \\\\\"Company\\\\\") as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in  Internal Control \\\\u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, e\\\\ufb00ective internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in  Internal Control \\\\u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated \\\\ufb01nancial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated July 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company\\'s management is responsible for maintaining e\\\\ufb00ective internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting and for its assessment of the e\\\\ufb00ectiveness of internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting \\\\ufb01rm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether e\\\\ufb00ective internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating e\\\\ufb00ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company\\'s internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \\\\ufb01nancial reporting and the preparation of \\\\ufb01nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re\\\\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \\\\ufb01nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over \\\\ufb01nancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e\\\\ufb00ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/ D ELOITTE  & T OUCHE  LLP\", \"the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/ D ELOITTE  & T OUCHE  LLP   Seattle, Washington July 28, 2022\", \"PART II, III Item 9B, 9C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14     ITEM 9B.

Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge   Platform As digital transformation and adoption of AI accelerates and revolutionizes more business workstreams, organizations in every sector across the globe   can address challenges that will have a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes   operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. We continue to invest in high performance and   sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and   datacenters. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than   smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of   computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. The Microsoft Cloud provides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and   increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and   compliance.

Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology   over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: \\\\u2022 Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people   communicate, collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another. \\\\u2022\", \"communicate, collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another. \\\\u2022 Building and running cloud-based services in ways that utilize ubiquitous computing to unleash new experiences and opportunities for   businesses and individuals. \\\\u2022 Applying AI and ambient intelligence to drive insights, revolutionize many types of work, and provide substantive productivity gains using natural   methods of communication.\", \"PART I Item 1   \\\\u2022 Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all   clouds and platforms. \\\\u2022 Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of   innovation with console and PC gaming. \\\\u2022 Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft   365 Consumer, Microsoft  Teams, Microsoft  Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more. Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment to Sustainability Microsoft\\\\u2019s approach to addressing climate change starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we committed to being a carbon negative,   water positive, and zero waste company by 2030.   In May 2023, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress during fiscal year 2022. We continued to make   progress on our goals, with our overall emissions declining by 0.5 percent. While our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued to decline, Scope 3   emissions increased by 0.5 percent. Scope 3 represented 96 percent of our total emissions, resulting primarily from the operations of our suppliers and   the use of our products across our customers.   A few examples of our continued progress include: \\\\u2022 Signed new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 gigawatts. \\\\u2022 Contracted for water replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million cubic meters in volumetric water benefit over   the lifetime of these projects. \\\\u2022 Diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our direct operational footprint. \\\\u2022 Protected 12,270 acres of land in Belize \\\\u2013 more than the 11,206 acres of land that we use around the world. Microsoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution can be offered by any single company,   organization, or government. Our approach helps to support the sustainability needs of our customers and the global community. Our Microsoft Cloud for   Sustainability, an environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager, enables organizations to record,   report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. These digital tools can interoperate with business systems and unify data intelligence for   organizations. Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity We are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived   experiences at Microsoft, in employees\\\\u2019 communities, and beyond. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions   and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025. \\\\u2022 Strengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black and African American people in the   United States, including our employees and their communities. \\\\u2022 Engaging our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster societal change and create new   opportunities. \\\\u2022 Increasing representation and strengthening inclusion: building on our momentum by adding a $150 million investment to strengthen inclusion   and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx leaders in the United States by 2025.\", \"PART I Item 1   In fiscal year 2023, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and   programs, including:   \\\\u2022 Working with 103 unique organizations in 165 cities and counties on our Justice Reform Initiative to empower communities and advance racial   equity and fairness in the justice system. \\\\u2022 Increasing access to affordable broadband, devices, and digital literacy training across 14 geographies, including 11 cities and three states in   the Black Rural south. \\\\u2022 Growing our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American Communities program, which uses data, technology, and partnerships   to help more than 2,000 local organizations to modernize and streamline operations. \\\\u2022 Expanding our Technology Education and Learning Support (\\\\u201cTEALS\\\\u201d) program to reach nearly 400 high schools in 21 communities to increase   computer science opportunities for Black and African American students. We exceeded our 2020 goal to double the percentage of our transaction volumes with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions by 2023.   We are also increasing investment activity with Black- and African American-owned asset managers, which now represent 45 percent of our external   manager group, enabling increased funds into local communities. We also met our goal of creating a $100 million program focused on mission-driven   banks. We enriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black- and African American-owned   suppliers. We also increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative by more than 250 percent, surpassing our initial goal.   We have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. As of June 2023, we are 93 percent of the way to our 2025 commitment   to double the number of Black and African American people managers in the U.S. (below director level), and 107 percent of the way for Black and African   American directors (people managers and individual contributors). We are 28 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers (below director   level) and 74 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx directors. Investing in Digital Skills After helping over 80 million jobseekers around the world access digital skilling resources, we introduced a new Skills for Jobs initiative to support a more   skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our Skills   for Jobs initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is   built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn\\\\u2019s Economic Graph.   We also launched a national campaign to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the   country\\\\u2019s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation\\\\u2019s higher education institutions, providing   training for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. We have expanded the cyber skills   initiative to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, partnering with   nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers. Generative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has the skills to use it. To address this, in June   2023 we launched a new AI Skills Initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering\", \"2023 we launched a new AI Skills Initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an   environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful,   rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission.\", \"PART I Item 1   As of June 30, 2023, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 120,000 in the U.S. and 101,000 internationally. Of the total   employed people, 89,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 72,000 were in product   research and development; 45,000 were in sales and marketing; and 15,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to   collective bargaining agreements. Our Culture Microsoft\\\\u2019s culture is grounded in growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company instead   of multiple siloed businesses.   Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally.   Employees participate in our Employee Signals surveys, which cover a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning   and development. We also collect Daily Signals employee survey responses, giving us real-time insights into ways we can support our employees. In   addition to Employee Signals and Daily Signals surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, exit surveys, internal Viva Engage channels, employee   Q&A sessions, and our internal AskHR Service support. Diversity and inclusion are core to our business model, and we hold ourselves accountable for driving global systemic change in our workforce and   creating an inclusive work environment. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities,   military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as LGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building.   As described in our 2022 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their   contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics   including: \\\\u2022 Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and   segments of our business. \\\\u2022 Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity). \\\\u2022 Disability representation. \\\\u2022 Pay equity (see details below).   Total Rewards and Pay Equity We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and   retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset.   Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our   colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. Our total compensation opportunity is highly differentiated and is   market competitive. In order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal year 2023 we announced that base salaries of salaried employees would   remain at fiscal year 2022 levels. Pay increases continue to be available for rewards-eligible hourly and equivalent employees. We will continue our   practice of investing in stock for all rewards-eligible employees, salaried and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees.\", \"PART I Item 1   Since 2016, we have reported on pay equity as part of our annual Diversity and Inclusion report. In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority   employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000   earned by their counterparts who are men, and that women outside the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S.   who are men. In this year\\\\u2019s report, we again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year),   representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce. In addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees regardless of factors such   as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the   U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to   increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the   medians will reduce.   Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay   by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellbeing and Hybrid Work Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees\\\\u2019 wellbeing while they are at work and in their personal lives. We have invested significantly in   wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling   through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, disability accommodations, savings and   investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure   employees can stay safe while they are working. We introduced Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guidance to better support leaders, managers, and employees in hybrid work scenarios. Our ongoing survey   data shows that 93% of employees value the flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and 78% are satisfied with the quality of   connection with co-workers. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to flexible work at Microsoft. As a company, we will continue to leverage data and   research to inform decision making, balancing the needs of business, team, and individual. Learning and Development We offer a range of learning opportunities, including personalized opportunities on our internal and external learning portals, in-classroom learning,   required learning on compliance and company culture, on-the-job advancement opportunities, and manager coaching. We also provide customized   manager learning, new employee orientation, and tools for operating in a flexible hybrid work environment.   All Microsoft employees globally access our single Viva Learning tool for both required and personal choice learning. This includes courses focused on   our core principles and compliance matters, such as Business Conduct, Privacy, Security Foundations, and Harassment Prevention. We also deliver   skills training for employees based on their profession and role discipline.

We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and   middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers.   IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions.   Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our   web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against   Java vendors.   Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, Snowflake, and other   companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA   Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other   companies, and also against open source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.   We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior   applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.   Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and   infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.   More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This   segment primarily comprises: \\\\u2022 Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (\\\\u201cWindows OEM\\\\u201d) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows   Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings;   patent licensing; and Windows IoT. \\\\u2022 Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.   \\\\u2022 Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game   content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services.   \\\\u2022 Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates. Windows The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience,   applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses\", \"applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses   purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted   by:   \\\\u2022 The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size. \\\\u2022 Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets. \\\\u2022 Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.\", \"PART I Item 1   \\\\u2022 Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises. \\\\u2022 Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel. \\\\u2022 Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system   builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed. \\\\u2022 Constraints in the supply chain of device components. \\\\u2022 Piracy. Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft   Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance (\\\\u201cSA\\\\u201d), as well as   advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively   independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud   offerings. Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use   in embedded devices.   Devices We design and sell devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect   to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations,   students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product   roadmap, and expanding into new categories. Gaming Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud services. Our   exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences.   We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique   gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 400   first- and third-party console and PC titles. The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points   through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We\\\\u2019ve seen new devices from third- party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are   focused on growing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible.   Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other   devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner   ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as   well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games,   providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and   the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.\", \"PART I Item 1   Search and News Advertising Our Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. Our Microsoft   Edge browser and Bing Chat capabilities are key tools to enable user acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated   delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we   provide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content on   advertising offerings. Competition   Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe   Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of   hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.   Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design   and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers,   include Apple and our Windows OEMs. Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by   Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming   platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming   platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware   architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party   game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide   content and online offerings to end users.   OPERATIONS   We have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order processing, billing, credit and collections,   information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The center in Ireland supports the African, Asia-Pacific, European, and Middle East   regions; and the centers in  Arlington, Virginia, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Redmond,   Washington, Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico support the American regions. In addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to   expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for   AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including   graphics processing units (\\\\u201cGPUs\\\\u201d) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other   manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components   for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet   consumer demand.\", \"PART I Item 1   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT   Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property   We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.   \\\\u2022   Cloud and AI  \\\\u2013 focuses on making IT professionals, developers, partners, independent software vendors, and their systems more productive   and efficient through development of Azure AI platform and cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and   services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. \\\\u2022   Strategic Missions and Technologies  \\\\u2013 focuses on incubating technical products and support solutions with transformative potential for the   future of cloud computing and continued company growth across quantum computing, Azure Space & Missions Engineering,   telecommunications, and Microsoft Federal Sales and Delivery. \\\\u2022   Experiences and Devices  \\\\u2013 focuses on delivering high value end-user experiences across our products, services, and devices, including   Microsoft 365, Windows, Microsoft Teams, Search (including Microsoft Edge and Bing Chat) and other advertising-based services, and the   Surface line of devices. \\\\u2022   Microsoft Security  \\\\u2013 focuses on delivering a comprehensive portfolio of services that protect our customers\\\\u2019 digital infrastructure through cloud   platform and application security, data protection and governance, identity and network access, and device management.   \\\\u2022   Technology and Research  \\\\u2013 focuses on fundamental research, product and business incubations, and forward-looking AI innovations that span   infrastructure, services, and applications. \\\\u2022   LinkedIn  \\\\u2013 focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs and the way businesses hire, market,   sell, and learn.   \\\\u2022   Gaming  \\\\u2013 focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game   experiences and social interaction. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products   and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented.   We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware   design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a   range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally.   We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of   copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We   are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 70,000 U.S. and international patents issued and   over 19,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we also engage in   outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees\\\\u2019 products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license   agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our   products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as\", \"products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as   promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external   development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in   certain situations. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past   experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and   product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.\", \"PART I Item 1   Investing in the Future   Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive   technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of   emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the   company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide   spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems.   While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in   other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top   talent from across the world.   We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and as appropriate we will   coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company.   In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world\\\\u2019s largest   corporate research organizations, often working in close collaboration with top universities around the world, and is focused on advancing the state-of- the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines. Our investment in fundamental research provides us a unique perspective on future   trends and contributes to our innovation.   DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING   We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales organization   performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their   technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and   other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services. OEMs   We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the   OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and   services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.   There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct   agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational   OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders   consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft   distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.   Direct   Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts,   with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our\", \"with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our   products and services (\\\\u201cEnterprise Agreement Software Advisors\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cESA\\\\u201d). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and   corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.   We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital   marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and   customers across industries.\", \"PART I Item 1   Distributors and Resellers   Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (\\\\u201cLSP\\\\u201d), distributors, value-added resellers   (\\\\u201cVAR\\\\u201d), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations,   distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate   as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.   We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets.   Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of   field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.   Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and   specialized services.   LICENSING OPTIONS   We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations under   volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses   through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in   various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.   SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and   other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional   purchase with others. Volume Licensing Programs Enterprise Agreement   Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and   software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and   on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is   included.   Microsoft Customer Agreement A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital experience. A Microsoft   Customer Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly   from Microsoft. Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement A Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is   designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain   cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based   services. Microsoft Products and Services Agreement   Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises   software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or   subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses.\", \"PART I Item 1   Open Value Open Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements are designed for small and   medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-year period. Under Open Value agreements,   organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included.   Select Plus   A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level,   while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional.   Partner Programs   The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value- added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package   their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible   Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year   period and are billed monthly based on consumption. The Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified   business solution to their end users. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service   providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers;   consequently, backlog is not significant.

RIS K FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our   business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose   narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our   businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and   frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices,   and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A   well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate   growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from   firms that provide competing platforms. \\\\u2022 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services,   has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint   devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including   applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their   vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion   of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. \\\\u2022 We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms   developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including   price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past   were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of   these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating   systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing   platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment   manufacturer (\\\\u201cOEM\\\\u201d) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. \\\\u2022 Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and   applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and\", \"applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and   applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that   these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors\\\\u2019 content and application   marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors\\\\u2019 rules governing their content and applications   marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model   objectives.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. \\\\u2022 Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based   proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software   products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many   of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. \\\\u2022 We are investing in artificial intelligence (\\\\u201cAI\\\\u201d) across the entire company and infusing generative AI capabilities into our consumer and   commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant   development and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our   customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny. \\\\u2022 Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising.   Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with   our revenue-generating products. \\\\u2022   Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source   AI models,   and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and   development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for   research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.  A growing part of our business involves cloud-based   services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and   productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors   are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices   and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\\\\u2019s choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain   industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks.   We are devoting significant resources to   develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural   and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected   to the growth of the Internet of Things (\\\\u201cIoT\\\\u201d), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities,   including AI. Our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure,   Azure AI, and Azure IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will\", \"Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will   reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas,   including: \\\\u2022 Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. \\\\u2022 Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs,   smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints. \\\\u2022 Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. \\\\u2022 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them   meet their own compliance needs. \\\\u2022 Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our   competitors.\", \"PART I Item 1A   It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational   and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we   may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and   operating income. Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen   credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service   such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse   are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage. RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.  We will continue to make significant   investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system,   Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on   developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services.   We also invest in the development and acquisition of a   variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new   technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and   marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of   new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service,   and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable,   operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get   engagement in certain features, like  Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices   across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public   reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems   in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.  We expect to continue making acquisitions and   entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of   ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in  March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022   we announced a definitive agreement to acquire  Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI\", \"we announced a definitive agreement to acquire  Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI   strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance   our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we   have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or   that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it   may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability   to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies\\\\u2019 ability to meet our   policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from   these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected.   These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\", \"PART I Item 1A   If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.  We acquire   other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill   or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not   be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our   goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow   estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to   record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible   assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or   competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored   organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of   methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes  in hardware,   software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering   techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain   access to our data or our users\\\\u2019 or customers\\\\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks.   Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or   our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or   organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely   remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\\\\u2019 security or   systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or   compromised supplier accounts or hardware. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully   defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the   environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and   systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and   business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,\", \"business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,   compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual   property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of   attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business.   We are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software   provider\\\\u2019s customers, including us, through software updates. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of   sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented   technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries.   Our business policies and   internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Security of our products, services, devices, and customers\\\\u2019 data The security of our products and services is important in our customers\\\\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on- premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to   others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our   infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data.   Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to   continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\\\\u2019 on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\\\\u201czero day\\\\u201d)   vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any   product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the   vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers\\\\u2019 systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers   using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to   compromise our users\\\\u2019 accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may   also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\\\\u2019s use of our products or   services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make   our products susceptible to cyberattacks.   Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new   field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated   security threats from sophisticated adversaries. Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many   years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current   security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely   because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers\\\\u2019   vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still   have limited   capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for   this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these   settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our   customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are\", \"customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are   also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these   attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as   Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\\\\u2019 computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\\\\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more   secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security   vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even   when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and   provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the   impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized   requirements to which we must engineer our products and services.\", \"PART I Item 1A   The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or   perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead   customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also   spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and   third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or   may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our   reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that   eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial   objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security   vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or   harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.  As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of   our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of   high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the   security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third   parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors   store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper   disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal   data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process   personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce   customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and   appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the   collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption   of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user   concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or   governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.\", \"governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services   contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our   members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third   parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the   value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn,   Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is   hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of AI technologies,   dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services   that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make   substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated   financial statements.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Other digital safety abuses Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or    disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our   terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal   frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations   and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to   continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content   moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks.  To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge,   we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT.  The IoT\\\\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and   services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has   multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the   weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions   may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly   affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or   businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands,   or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability . We are building AI into many of our offerings,   including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by   Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI   operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations,   AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed.   Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful.   Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI   solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain   outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could   subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the   European Union (\\\\u201cEU\\\\u201d), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some   AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences,\", \"AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences,   unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or   other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial   statements.\", \"PART I Item 1A   OPERATIONAL RISKS We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations   infrastructure.  Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We   spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle   more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,  predictable energy,   networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\\\\u201cGPUs\\\\u201d) and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies   could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and   geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation   of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online,   Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform   and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and   complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain   an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that   continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity,   insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user   experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current   and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. We may experience quality or supply problems.  Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and   market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and   reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing,   or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs   and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads.   Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or   reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or   remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that   eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for\", \"There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for   hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity   constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies,   resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services.   Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox   consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in   the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.  Government   agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this   includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert   claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our   business.\", \"PART I Item 1A   For example, the European Commission (\\\\u201cthe Commission\\\\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we   make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship   product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws.   Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result,   increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory   scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their   competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and   businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated,   potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways,   including   causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability   to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value. Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage.   The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\\\\u201cFCPA\\\\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\\\\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\\\\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our   employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal   controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others   about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate   them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory   complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different   forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise   attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and   have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors,   or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties,   criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and   investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls   restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls\", \"restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls   restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions   involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the   availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may   result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative   impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions   could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal   claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.  The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the   movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to   evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\\\\u201cDPF\\\\u201d) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal   data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data   transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the   transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost   and complexity of delivering our products and services.   In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\\\\u201cGDPR\\\\u201d), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or   related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the   EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that   add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate   compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced   demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and   other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how   particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints   made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational   damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing,   especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are   considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data. Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to   operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be   constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by   regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data   sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as   the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business\", \"the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business   practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms.   Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate.   Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative   publicity and diversion of management time and effort.   Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.  We are subject to a wide range of   laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those   that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several   jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as   regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security,   law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer   data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as   cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements.   Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.   Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and   organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or   restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of   our AI services in the European market.\", \"PART I Item 1A   How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction   to jurisdiction. In addition, governments\\\\u2019 approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing,   expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our   results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is   increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do   not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.  We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may   arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services,  significant business   transactions, warranty or product claims,  employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant   monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent   uncertainties and management\\\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements   could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties.  We derive substantial revenue from government contracts.   Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to   government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil   and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate   without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions,   cancellations,  or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our   results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We may have additional tax liabilities.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in   determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax   determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\\u201cTCJA\\\\u201d) and possible future legislative changes   may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and   the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future   legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially   affect our consolidated financial statements. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are\", \"We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are   reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in   various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years,   with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the   amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in   which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax   rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher   effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other   fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\\\\u2019 administrative   interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\", \"PART I Item 1A   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be   harmed.  Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global   basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally,   licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our   increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are   unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code   leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying   functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security   risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property.  From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To   resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or   redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include   monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing   technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual   property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. GENERAL RISKS If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally   recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector   customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental   impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy   groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our   brands may occur from, among other things:   \\\\u2022 The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. \\\\u2022 Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.   \\\\u2022 Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.   The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it   could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.  Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other\", \"Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.  Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other   changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing   devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.   Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a   significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could   cause sales channel disruption.   Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result,   allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\", \"PART I Item 1A   We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and   interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment   portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government   credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that   more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial   statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.  A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major   earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing   services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain   other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California,   both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems,   or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers   with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans   and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.   Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in   affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets.   These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain   disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that   could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to   sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our   revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of   operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the   pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals\\' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of   recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash   flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the\", \"flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the   supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources,   necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to   develop software and provide cloud-based services.\", \"PART I Item 1A   Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.  Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our   revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations   may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes.   In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of   social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and   protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and   commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher   tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more   difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our   products and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international   currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of   operations.   Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.  Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining   talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is   extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive,   are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration   laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our   research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our   ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term   success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and   execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less   flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S.   and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to   form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to   respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\", \"PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4   ITEM 1B.

OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create   local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence (\\\\u201cAI\\\\u201d),   that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes,   grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.   We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting   an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant   expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing,   manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes. Highlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included: \\\\u2022 Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion. \\\\u2022 Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%. \\\\u2022 Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million. \\\\u2022 LinkedIn revenue increased 10%. \\\\u2022 Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%. \\\\u2022 Server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%. \\\\u2022 Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\\\\u201cWindows OEM\\\\u201d) revenue decreased 25%. \\\\u2022 Devices revenue decreased 24%. \\\\u2022 Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%. \\\\u2022 Xbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.   \\\\u2022 Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%. Industry Trends   Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to   conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of   what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and   users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\", \"PART II Item 7   Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and   devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve   rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user\\\\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.   Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.   We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.   The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating   margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving   needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable   land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\\\\u201cGPUs\\\\u201d) and other components. Our devices are   primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current   vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very   few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.   Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We   compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow   one\\\\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in   currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the   U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023. On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in   strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\\\\u201cQ2 charge\\\\u201d),   which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to   lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to   the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key   strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other   areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder   of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality\", \"Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by   corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the   volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.   Change in Accounting Estimate In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased   efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated   useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year   2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this   change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and   diluted share.\", \"PART II Item 7   Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal   Computing.

Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments.   INCOME TAXES   Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3   billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to   stock-based compensation. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible   properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the   current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from   producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution   of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign   income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before   income taxes was $35.9 billion. Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\\\\u201cIRS\\\\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its   2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled   a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In   the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion,   including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.\", \"PART II Item 7   As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated   financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a   proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on   the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12   months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years   1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our   consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures   exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware   portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures  exclude the net income tax benefit related to   transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments   Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $111.3 billion and $104.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity   investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate   liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and   individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to   diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income   portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is   insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.   Valuation   In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial   instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual   funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar   assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2   investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed   securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable   inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.   A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted   market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a   quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in   which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments   based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to   demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure   appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and   independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.   Cash Flows\", \"independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.   Cash Flows   Cash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and   cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9   billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset   in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion   decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion   decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\", \"PART II Item 7   Debt Proceeds We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.   The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working   capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.

Unearned Revenue   Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (\\\\u201cSA\\\\u201d) and cloud   services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably   over the coverage period.

Under the   TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year   seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $7.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2023. The remaining transition tax of   $10.5 billion is payable over the next three years, with $2.7 billion payable within 12 months.   In fiscal year 2023, we paid cash tax of $4.8 billion due to the mandatory capitalization for tax purposes of research and development expenditures   enacted by the TCJA and effective on July 1, 2022.   Share Repurchases   During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 69 million shares and 95 million shares of our common stock for $18.4 billion and $28.0 billion,   respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2023, $22.3 billion remained of   our $60 billion share repurchase program.

Other Planned Uses of Capital   On January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (\\\\u201cActivision Blizzard\\\\u201d) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash   transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard\\\\u2019s net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard\\\\u2019s shareholders.   We continue to work toward closing the transaction subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and  satisfaction of other customary closing   conditions. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through October 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to   resolve remaining regulatory concerns. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that   align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for   research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support   growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research   and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or   arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical   accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial\", \"accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial   condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities,   goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\", \"PART II Item 7   Revenue Recognition   Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services   are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud- based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is   considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain   cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and   cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which   the cloud services are provided.   Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\\\\u201cSSP\\\\\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate   SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a   range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be   allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.   In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using   information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services   due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of   the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.   Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern   of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.   Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of   our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits   are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated   variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.   Impairment of Investment Securities   We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other   factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination   requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative   evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and   business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before   recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the   investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\", \"investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.   Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is   impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to   estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an   impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\", \"PART II Item 7   Goodwill   We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on   an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit   level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or   circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances   could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a   significant portion of a reporting unit.   Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to   reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is   estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future   cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which   cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.   The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other   factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting   unit.   Research and Development Costs   Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been   established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to   customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological   feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this   occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the   products.   Legal and Other Contingencies   The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such   as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the   amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of   probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially   impact our consolidated financial statements.\", \"PART II Item 7   Income Taxes   The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities   and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\\\\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax   benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based   on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest   benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of   income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax   positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our   consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our   consolidated financial statements.   Inventories   Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead   related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and   transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our   inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing   strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis   through a charge to cost of revenue.\", \"PART II Item 7   STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\\\\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles   Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United   States of America (\\\\u201cGAAP\\\\u201d). We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on   our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.   Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have   been eliminated.   Estimates and Assumptions   Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,   and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance   obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\\\\u201cSSP\\\\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as   product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our   reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand   for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of   uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of   impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\\\\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased   efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well  as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated   useful lives of both server and network equipment from  four years  to  six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year   2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this   change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $ 3.7  billion and net income of $ 3.0  billion, or $ 0.40  per both basic and   diluted share. Foreign Currencies   Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated   at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive   income.   Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue   Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution   applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and   entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.   Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as   Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online   advertising and LinkedIn.\", \"PART II Item 8   Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to   receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are   generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any   taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.   Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers   may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over   which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software   is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional   charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (\\\\u201cSA\\\\u201d). SA   conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and   use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is   generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct   performance obligations that are satisfied over time.   Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either   a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period.   Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the   customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual   components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.   Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue   has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.   Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system.   In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time   when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.   Refer to Note 19 \\\\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services   are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-\", \"are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud- based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is   considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain   cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and   cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which   the cloud services are provided.\", \"PART II Item 8   Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold   separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate   SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative   SSP of the various products and services.   In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using   information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services   due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of   the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.   Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern   of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.   Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of   our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits   are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated   variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables   Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing,   or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the   beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an   unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.   Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned   revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage   period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions,   Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn   the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.   Refer to Note 13 \\\\u2013 Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the   period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.  In instances where   the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing   component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and   services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a   subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue   recognized upfront.\", \"subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue   recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 4.5  billion and $ 3.8  billion, respectively, and   is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the   allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\", \"PART II Item 8   Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:     (In millions)                                                                             Year Ended June 30,     2023       2022       2021                       Balance, beginning of period   $ 710     $ 798     $ 816   Charged to costs and other     258       157       234   Write-offs     ( 252 )     ( 245 )     ( 252 )                                               Balance, end of period   $ 716     $ 710     $ 798                               Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:   (In millions)                                                                             June 30,     2023       2022       2021                       Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts   $ 650     $ 633     $ 751   Other long-term assets     66       77       47                                                 Total   $ 716     $ 710     $ 798                               As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server  components were $ 9.2  billion and $ 6.1  billion,   respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.   We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a   financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, our financing receivables, net were $ 5.3  billion and $ 4.1  billion,   respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated   balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available   evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one   year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were   immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.   We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have   been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we   have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue   Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support   service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\\\\u201cOEM\\\\u201d), to drive   traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other  online products and   services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting   services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives   of the products.\", \"PART II Item 8   Product Warranty   We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For   hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge   of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which   we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate   the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the   adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.   Research and Development   Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses   associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the   amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development   expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to   production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.   Sales and Marketing   Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses   associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs   are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 904  million , $ 1.5  billion, and $ 1.5  billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   Stock-Based Compensation   Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\\\\u201cRSUs\\\\u201d) and performance stock units (\\\\u201cPSUs\\\\u201d), is measured at the fair value   on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards   is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.   We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and   for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\\\\u201cESPP\\\\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is   recognized in the period of purchase. Employee Severance On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately  10,000  jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year   2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $ 800  million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations   as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in   general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note   19 \\\\u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information. Income Taxes   Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses\", \"Income Taxes   Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses   are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income   taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred   income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\", \"PART II Item 8   Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair   values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and   remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as   short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current   operations.   Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair   value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market   information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general   market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ   a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to   the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to   sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new   cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are   measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the   measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the   fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.   Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a   derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.   For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and   losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other   income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and   subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components   excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.   For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income   (expense), net.\", \"PART II Item 8   Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in   measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest   level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:   \\\\u2022   Level 1  \\\\u2013 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S.   government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded   on exchanges.   \\\\u2022   Level 2  \\\\u2013 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in   markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable   in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these   models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest   rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial   paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and   bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter   forward, option, and swap contracts. \\\\u2022   Level 3  \\\\u2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\\\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in   pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and   discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and   goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are   significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.   We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined   based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash   flow projections.   Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories   Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead   related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and   transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our   inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of   revenue.   Property and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated   useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed   or acquired for internal use,  three  years ; computer equipment,  two  to  six  years ; buildings and improvements,  five\", \"or acquired for internal use,  three  years ; computer equipment,  two  to  six  years ; buildings and improvements,  five  to  15 years ; leasehold improvements,   three  to  20 years ; and furniture and equipment,  one  to  10 years . Land is not depreciated.   Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\\\\u201cROU\\\\u201d) assets, other current   liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current   liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\", \"PART II Item 8   ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising   from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over   the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of   interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any   lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain   that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as   vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a   portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.   Goodwill   Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and   between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its   carrying value.   Intangible Assets   Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from   one  to  20 years . We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised   estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.   NOTE 2 \\\\u2014 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (\\\\u201cEPS\\\\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted   EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding   during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of   these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting   treatment.   Foreign Currencies   Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize   the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.   Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are   designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange   forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance   sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.   Interest Rate   Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to   effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our   fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts.   These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \\\\u201cOther contracts\\\\u201d in the tables below. Equity   Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These   contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. Credit   Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit   exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are   included in \\\\u201cOther contracts\\\\u201d in the tables below. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features   Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to   maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0  billion.

We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the   India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for   companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were   not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax   benefit of $ 620  million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year  1996  through   fiscal year  2016 .   The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from   producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal statutory   rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign   jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits   relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in   foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and   Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes.  In fiscal   year 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated  81 % of our foreign income before   tax.

The   decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $ 3.3  billion net income tax benefit in the first   quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between   the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement   between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\\u201cTCJA\\\\u201d) regulations.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows:     (In millions)                                                           Year Ended June 30,   2023 2022 2021           Beginning unrecognized tax benefits   $ 15,593     $ 14,550     $ 13,792   Decreases related to settlements     ( 329 )     ( 317 )     ( 195 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year     1,051       1,145       790   Increases for tax positions related to prior years     870       461       461   Decreases for tax positions related to prior years     ( 60 )     ( 246 )     ( 297 ) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations     ( 5 )     0       ( 1 )                                                     Ending unrecognized tax benefits   $ 17,120     $ 15,593     $ 14,550                               We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\\\\u201cIRS\\\\u201d) audit for tax years  2004  to  2006  in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its   2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled   a portion of the IRS audit for tax years  2007  to  2009  in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years  2010  to  2013  in fiscal year 2018. In   the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years  2004  to  2013  and made a payment of $ 1.7  billion,   including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years  2004  to  2017 . As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated   financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a   proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on   the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12   months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years   1996  to  2022 , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our   consolidated financial statements.\", \"PART II Item 8   NOTE 13 \\\\u2014 UNEARNED REVENUE   Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:     (In millions)                         June 30,   2023     2022         Productivity and Business Processes   $ 27,572     $ 24,558   Intelligent Cloud     21,563       19,371   More Personal Computing     4,678       4,479                           Total   $ 53,813     $ 48,408                       Changes in unearned revenue were as follows:     (In millions)                       Year Ended June 30, 2023                 Balance, beginning of period     $ 48,408   Deferral of revenue       123,935   Recognition of unearned revenue       ( 118,530 )                         Balance, end of period     $ 53,813                 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue   in future periods, was $ 229  billion as of June 30, 2023, of which $ 224  billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize   approximately  45 % of this revenue over the next  12  months and the remainder thereafter.

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia\\\\u2019s Devices and Services   business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial   proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health   effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission   guidelines (\\\\u201cFCC Guidelines\\\\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were   manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing   around emission guidelines.   In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific   methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\\\\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 general causation experts. The   defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In   October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for   further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing   on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants\\\\u2019 motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 experts   that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 experts from testifying. Irish Data Protection Commission Matter In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (\\\\u201cIDPC\\\\u201d) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn\\\\u2019s targeted advertising   practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\\\\u201cGDPR\\\\u201d). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period   of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft   intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision. Other Contingencies   We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management   currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial   statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\\\\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.   As of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ 617  million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that   we estimate could reach approximately $ 600  million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to   occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become   reasonably estimable.\", \"PART II Item 8   NOTE 16  \\\\u2014  STOCKHOLDERS\\\\u2019 EQUITY   Shares Outstanding   Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:     (In millions)                                 Year Ended June 30,   2023 2022 2021           Balance, beginning of year     7,464 7,519 7,571 Issued     37 40 49   Repurchased     ( 69 ) ( 95 ) ( 101 )                                         Balance, end of year     7,432   7,464 7,519                               Share Repurchases On September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 40.0  billion in share repurchases.

NOTE 19 \\\\u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain   financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods   presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More   Personal Computing.   We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Our reportable segments are described below.   Productivity and Business Processes   Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information   services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: \\\\u2022 Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on- premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365   Copilot. \\\\u2022 Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other Office services. \\\\u2022 LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. \\\\u2022 Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM (including   Customer Insights), Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications. Intelligent Cloud   Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and   developers. This segment primarily comprises:   \\\\u2022 Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and   related Client Access Licenses (\\\\u201cCALs\\\\u201d); and Nuance and GitHub.   \\\\u2022 Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions (formerly Microsoft Consulting Services), and Nuance   professional services.   More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This   segment primarily comprises: \\\\u2022 Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial,   comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent   licensing; and Windows Internet of Things. \\\\u2022 Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.\", \"PART II Item 8   \\\\u2022 Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game   content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services. \\\\u2022 Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates. Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue   recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on   the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or   estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are   allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based   on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs    generally include legal, including   settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and   support ,  and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of   the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with   respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and   Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain   reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included   performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing   procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in   the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as   well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Company offers customers the ability to acquire   multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing   programs.\", \"PART II Item 8   Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: \\\\u2022 Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus   together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services. \\\\u2022 The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation. \\\\u2022 Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional   purchases, and free services).   \\\\u2022 Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately. Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management\\'s judgments in determining revenue   recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company\\'s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following: \\\\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of   revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.     \\\\u2022 We evaluated management\\'s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.     \\\\u2022 We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:     - Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the   agreement.     - Tested management\\'s identification and treatment of contract terms.       - Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management\\'s application of their accounting policies,   along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.     \\\\u2022 We evaluated the reasonableness of management\\'s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold   separately.     \\\\u2022 We tested the mathematical accuracy of management\\'s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the   financial statements. Income Taxes \\\\u2013 Uncertain Tax Positions \\\\u2013 Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company\\'s long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the   Internal Revenue Service (\\\\\"IRS\\\\\"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the   Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial   statements.   Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex   considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the   subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management\\'s estimates relating to their   determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax   specialists.\", \"PART II Item 8   How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management\\'s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues   included the following: \\\\u2022 We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management\\'s methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition,   measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls. \\\\u2022 We read and evaluated management\\'s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from   outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions. \\\\u2022 We tested the reasonableness of management\\'s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation   of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. \\\\u2022 For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new   information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions. \\\\u2022 We evaluated the reasonableness of management\\'s estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted   management\\'s judgments.   /s/  D ELOITTE  & T OUCHE  LLP   Seattle, Washington July 27, 2023   We have served as the Company\\'s auditor since 1983.\", \"PART II Item 9, 9A   ITEM 9.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures   are effective.   REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL C ONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over   financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in   reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for   preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in   accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets   that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent   limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial   statements would be prevented or detected.   Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in  Internal Control \\\\u2013   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation,   management concluded that the Company\\\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023. There were no changes in our   internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,   our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023; their   report is included in Item 9A.\", \"PART II Item 9A   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the \\\\\"Company\\\\\") as of June 30, 2023,   based on criteria established in  Internal Control \\\\u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the   Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting   as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in  Internal Control \\\\u2014 Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the   consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated July 27, 2023, expressed an   unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion   The Company\\'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the   effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial   Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a   public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.   federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain   reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included   obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating   the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered   necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial   reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A   company\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in   reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance   that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting   principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors   of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of   the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
